<h2>Preface</h2>
<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent">When the author of the following papers came to Scotland,
many years ago, he knew nothing of the country
that was to become his home, and was hardly less ignorant
of its history. To acquire some acquaintance with
both he followed the same plan: he began with the highways,
as indicated, in the one case, by the advertisements
of the railway and steamboat companies, and, in the
other, by the works of Tytler and Hill Burton. Before
long, however, he learned that the knowledge thus obtained
might be pleasantly supplemented by independent
excursions off the beaten track. Topographically the result
was the discovery of charming bits of scenery, of which
he still recalls the picturesque beauty with delight. Historically,
too, he found his way into interesting nooks and
corners which his early guides had either ignored entirely
or contented themselves with referring to in the briefest
words. The outcome of some of his explorations&mdash;if it be
not presumptuous to apply such a term to them&mdash;is set
forth in the present volume. In venturing to publish it,
he is not without a hope that the interest which he has
felt in his rambles through some of the byways of Scottish
history may, to some extent, be shared by others. If he
should be disappointed in this, he will have to admit that
he has done less than justice to subjects that had it in
them to be made pleasant and attractive.</p>

<p class="indent">Those subjects are varied, but, as regards most of them,
not wholly unconnected. Dealing, as they mainly do,
with the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, they
have, at least, a certain chronological unity, and may, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
some slight degree, help to supplement the general knowledge
of one of the most picturesque periods in the history
of Scotland.</p>

<p class="indent">What has so far been said does not, it must be allowed,
apply very directly to one of the papers contained in the
present collection. It cannot be claimed for the "Longtail"
myth, of which the story is here given, that it is
essentially Scottish. It may, however, be urged in
support of its right to appear here, that it was French
at a time when, as regards antipathy against England,
the agreement between France and Scotland was a very
close one. And, if further justification be needed, it may
be found in the fact that some of the Scottish chroniclers
are amongst those who supply the most valuable information
concerning both the prevalence and the alleged origin
of the quaint medieval belief that Englishmen had tails
inflicted on them in punishment of the impiety of some of
their pagan forefathers.</p>

<p class="indent">In connection with this paper the author has the
pleasant duty of expressing his thanks to Dr. George
Neilson, to whom he is indebted for several illustrative
passages; and also to Mr. Barwick, of the British
Museum, without whose ready help a number of others
would have remained inaccessible.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the papers have appeared, mostly in a condensed
form, in the <cite>Glasgow Herald</cite> and the <cite>Evening
Times</cite>, and thankful acknowledgment is made of the permission
readily granted to make further use of them.</p>

<p class="indent">Responsibility is admitted, at the same time that indulgence
is craved, for the translations of old French poetry
and medieval Latin verse which occur in some of the
sketches.</p>

<p class="indent">In the case of the latter, more particularly, it has not
always proved an easy task to supply English versions of
the monkish doggerel. It is hoped, however, that if the
letter has been freely dealt with, the spirit has been
preserved.</p>

<h1>IN BYWAYS OF<br />SCOTTISH HISTORY</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<h2>MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS</h2>

<h3>A Brilliant Personality</h3>

<p class="indent">More than three hundred years have elapsed since
Mary Stuart was sent to the scaffold by Elizabeth,
and met death with that noble fortitude which awed
her enemies and which has half redeemed her fame
in the eyes even of those who regard the tragedy of
Fotheringay as an act no less of justice than of expediency.
But even at the present time interest in
her memory has not died away; nor can the question
of her innocence or of her guilt be yet said to have
been definitely settled by all that has been written
about her in the interval. It hardly seems probable
that it ever will be, for it is still a question of politics
with some and of religion with many. And even in
the rare instances where judgment is not blinded by
the prejudice or the partiality of party or of creed, it
is affected by an influence, nobler and more excusable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
indeed, but not less powerful nor less misleading&mdash;by
unreasoning sentiment, by the sympathy which the romance of the
unfortunate Queen's chequered career, her legendary beauty,
her long captivity, and her heroic death awaken.</p>

<p class="indent">In the controversy which has now raged for three
centuries, and in the course of which every incident
of Mary's life has repeatedly been submitted to the
closest scrutiny, anxiety to get at facts, to add to the
weight of evidence, to discover fresh witnesses, to unearth
new documents bearing on the points at issue,
has led to a disregard of her personality more complete,
perhaps, than in the case of any of her contemporaries,
and contrasting strangely with the
abundance of intimate details which go to make up
our knowledge of her great rival. To most of us
Elizabeth is as distinctly, almost tangibly, present as
though she had reigned in our day. She moves
through the pages of history surrounded by a train of
courtiers scarcely less familiar to us than those of our
own generation. The Queen of Scots, on the contrary,
seems to be but little more than an historical abstraction.
It is scarcely too much to say that many
for whom it would be an easy task to follow her, step
by step, from Linlithgow to Fotheringay, to recall
all the events of which she was the central figure,
to discuss all the problems which her name suggests,
would be at a loss to furnish such details as could
bring before us the features of the woman whose
beauty doubtless finds frequent mention in their discourses,
or bring together such particulars as would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
justify all that they are ready to admit, and perhaps
even to assert, concerning her talents and her accomplishments.
It may, therefore, be neither inopportune
nor uninteresting if, forgetting for a while the
history of the Queen, we give our attention to the
individuality of the woman; if, turning to the
"treasures of antiquity laid up in old historic rolls",
we endeavour, not to clear up the mystery of Darnley's
murder, nor to explain the fatal marriage with
Bothwell; not to pronounce on the authenticity of
the sonnets, nor to solve the enigma of the famous
letters; but to present a picture of the first lady of
the land as she appeared to the crowds that had
hurried to Leith to welcome her return, or that lined
the Canongate as she rode to the Parliament House;
to show her at her sports with her attendant Marys
at Stirling or at St. Andrews; to listen to the conversation
with which she entertained the courtiers of
Amboise and of Holyrood, and to glance at the pages
of the volumes over which she mused in the retirement
of her library or the solitude of her prison.</p>

<p class="indent">The historians of Mary Stuart all agree in telling
us that she was the most beautiful woman of her
age; and it must be admitted that this is fully borne
out by all that can be gathered from contemporary
writers. It is not only such poetic enthusiasts as
Michel de l'H&ocirc;pital, Du Bellay, and Ronsard, or
such courtly flatterers as Brant&ocirc;me and Castelnau,
who pronounce her beauty to have been matchless&mdash;far
exceeding "all that is, shall be, or has ever
been", but the serious and dignified chroniclers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
whom Jebb has brought together in his valuable
folios&mdash;Strada, Blackwood, and even de Thou&mdash;also
grow eloquent in praise of her charms. But
perhaps the most convincing testimony that can
be adduced is contained in a poem,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> composed
by an Englishman who was confessedly hostile to
Mary, and whose satire was so keenly felt by her
that she made it the subject of a formal complaint
to Elizabeth. The words attributed to her&mdash;for the
passage in which they occur is in the form of a confession
on her part&mdash;are scarcely less forcible than
those of her avowed partisans and admirers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But I could boast of beauty with the best,</span>
<span class="i0">In skilful points of princely attire</span>
<span class="i0">And of the golden gifts of nature's behest,</span>
<span class="i0">Who filled my face of favor fresh and fair.</span>
<span class="i0">My beauty shines like Ph&oelig;bus in the air,</span>
<span class="i0">And nature formed my features beside</span>
<span class="i0">In such proport as advanceth my pride.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus fame affatethe (<em>proclaims</em>) my state to the stars,</span>
<span class="i0">Enfeoft with the gifts of nature's device</span>
<span class="i0">That sound the retreat to other princes' ears,</span>
<span class="i0">Wholly to resign to me the chiefest prize.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">It is most remarkable, however, that no extant
portrait justifies the praises so lavishly bestowed on
Mary. As to this, the courtesy of the late Mr.
Wylie Guild, of Glasgow, afforded us an opportunity
of forming an opinion based on the evidence of his
remarkable collection of portraits of the Queen of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Scots&mdash;a collection which comprised, besides reproductions
of most of the paintings claiming to be
authentic, a series of over four hundred engravings,
many of them by Clouet, and dating from the period
of Mary's stay in France. We were compelled to
agree with the possessor of that unique iconography
that none of them showed the dazzling charms which
poets and chroniclers have celebrated. And the portraits
which various exhibitions have since then enabled
us to examine, have only confirmed that earlier
judgment. To reconcile this very striking contradiction
seems difficult. Possibly the truth may be that
the fascination of Mary's face consisted less in the
regularity of outline or the striking beauty of any
one feature than in the expression by which it was
animated.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Her complexion, though likened by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Ronsard to alabaster and ivory,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
does not seem to have possessed the clearness and brilliancy
which the comparison implies; for Sir James Melville,
though anxious to vindicate his Queen's claim to
be considered "very lovely" and "the fairest lady
in her country", acknowledged that she was less
"white" than Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
The brightness of her eyes, which Ronsard likened to stars, and Chastelard
to beacons,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
has not been questioned; but their
colour is a point about which there is less unanimity,
opinions varying between hazel and dark grey. As
regards her hair the discrepancy of contemporary
authorities is even greater. Brant&ocirc;me and Ronsard
describe a wealth of golden hair, and this is to a
certain extent confirmed by Sir James Melville,
who, when called upon by Elizabeth to pronounce
whether his Queen's hair was fairer than her own,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
answered that "the fairnes of them baith was not
their worst faltes".<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
To this, however, must be
opposed the testimony of Nicholas White, who,
writing to Cecil in 1563, described the Queen as
black-haired. The explanation of this may possibly
lie in Mary's compliance with the fashion, introduced
about this time, of wearing wigs. Indeed,
Knollys informed White that she wore "hair of
sundry colours",<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and, in a letter to Cecil, praised
the skill with which Mary Seton&mdash;"the finest busker
of hair to be seen in any country"&mdash;"did set such a
curled hair upon the Queen, that was said to be a
perewyke, that showed very delicately".<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">According to one account, the Queen of Scots
wore black, according to another, auburn ringlets
on the morning of her execution. Both, however,
agree in this, that when the false covering fell she
"appeared as grey as if she had been sixty and ten
years old".</p>

<p class="indent">Mary's hand was white, but not small, the long,
tapering fingers mentioned by Ronsard<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
being, indeed, a characteristic of some of her portraits. She
was of tall stature, taller than Elizabeth, which made
the Queen of England pronounce her cousin to be
too tall, she herself being, according to her own
standard, "neither too high nor too low".<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Her voice was irresistibly soft and sweet. Not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
does Brant&ocirc;me extol it as "tr&eacute;s douce et tr&eacute;s bonne",<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
and Ronsard poetically celebrate it as capable of
moving rocks and woods,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
but Knox, although ungraciously
and unwillingly, also testifies to its charm.
He informs us that, at one of her Parliaments, the
Queen made a "paynted orisoun", and that, on this
occasion, "thair mycht have been hard among hir
flatteraris, '<em>Vox Dian&aelig;!</em>' The voice of a goddess
(for it could not be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dei</i>) and not of a woman! God

</p>

<p class="indent">When, to this description, we have added that
Mary Stuart was of a full figure<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
and became actually stout in later life; that she is described in the report
of her execution and represented in several portraits
as having a double chin, we shall have given a picture
of her which, though wanting in some details, is as
complete as it is possible to sketch at this length of
time.</p>

<p class="indent">Mary Stuart is not infrequently mentioned as
one of the precocious children of history. But the
legend of her scholarly acquirements originates with
Brant&ocirc;me, an authority not always above suspicion
when the glorification of princes is his theme, and
it is not unnecessary to look more closely into the
matter before we accept his glowing panegyric of
the youthful prodigy. He informs us that Mary
was "very learned in Latin",<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and that, when only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
thirteen or fourteen years of age, she publicly delivered
at the Louvre, in the presence of King
Henry II, Catherine de' Medici, his Queen, and
the whole French Court, a Latin discourse which
she had composed in justification of her own course
of studies, and in support of the view that it is befitting
in women to devote themselves to letters and
to the liberal arts. This speech is also referred to
by Antoine Fouquelin in the dedication of a textbook
of Rhetoric which he composed for the young
Princess.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
He records the admiration with which
Mary had been listened to by the noble company,
and the high hopes which the elegant oration had
awakened. That she herself set some value on this
production may be assumed from the fact that she
was at the pains of translating it into French; and
the mention of it in the inventory of books delivered
by the Earl of Morton to James VI in
1578, where it appears as "ane Oratioun to the
King of Franche of the Quenis awin hand write",
would seem to imply that she looked back with
pride upon her youthful triumph. This interesting
manuscript has now disappeared; nevertheless,
it is not impossible to obtain from another source
a fairly accurate idea of the speech which called
forth such high praise from the French courtiers.
It happens that the National Library in Paris possesses
the Latin themes written by Mary Stuart in 1554,
the year before the oratorical performance at the
Louvre. Amongst the exercises contained in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
morocco-bound volume, fifteen refer to the same
subject as the speech, and, it is fair to suppose,
were intended as a preparation for the princely
pupil's "speech-day".<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Disappointing as it may be to ardent admirers of the Queen of Scots, it must
be admitted that her themes do not bear out the
praises bestowed on her Latinity, but contain such
solecisms as would probably have been fraught with
unpleasant consequences to a less noble and less fair
scholar. Neither need the substance of Mary's apology
for learned women excite our enthusiasm. To
string together, with a few commonplace remarks,
lists of names evidently supplied by her tutor and
taken by him from Politian's Epistles, was no very
remarkable achievement on the part of a child who,
if she began her classical studies as early as her fellow
pupil and sister-in-law Elizabeth did, had already devoted
fully five years to Latin at the date of her
famous speech.</p>

<p class="indent">But, though the Queen's early proficiency may
have been overrated, there can be no doubt that,
in later life, she possessed considerable familiarity
with the language of Virgil and of Cicero. We know
from contemporary letters that, after her return to
Scotland, she continued her studies under Buchanan<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and that, faithful to the habit which she had acquired
in France, of devoting two hours a day to her books,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
she regularly read "somewhat of Livy" with him
"after her dinner".</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
The catalogue of the books<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
contained in the royal library affords further information as to the nature
and extent of her acquaintance with Latin literature.
In it we find mention, amongst others of lesser note,
of Horace, Virgil and Cicero, of &AElig;milius Probus and
Columella, of Vegetius and Boethius. Neither did
she neglect the Latinity of the Middle Ages. In
prose it is represented by such forgotten names as
those of Bertram of Corvey, of Ludolph of Saxony,
of Joannes de Sacrobosco, and of Nicolaus de Clamangiis,
the authors of ponderous treatises on science
and on theology; the latter subject being one which
her interest in the great ecclesiastical revolution of
the age rendered particularly attractive to her.
Amongst contemporary Latin poets her favourites
seem to have been Petrus Barg&aelig;us, Louis Leroy, Sir
Thomas Craig of Riccarton, and George Buchanan,
whose dedication to her of his translation of the
Psalms has not unjustly been pronounced to stand
"unsurpassed by all the verses that have been
lavished upon her during three hundred years by
poets of almost every nation and language of
Europe".<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Whether the Queen of Scots was acquainted with
Greek cannot be determined with certainty. Neither
Brant&ocirc;me nor Con nor Blackwood has given information
on this head. If, on the one hand, her
numerous Latin and French translations of Greek
authors do not point to a great familiarity with it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
on the other, the knowledge that she used such
versions for the purpose of linguistic study, and
the presence on her shelves of Homer and Herodotus,
of Sophocles and Euripides, of Socrates and
Plato, of Demosthenes and Lucian in the original
tongue, justify the supposition that, even though
she may not have rivalled the fair pupils of Ascham
and of Aylmer, the productions of Athenian genius
were not sealed books to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Amongst modern languages Spanish was that with
which Mary had the slightest acquaintance, and so far
as may be judged from the works which she possessed,
her reading in it was limited to a book of chronicles
and a collection of ballads.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
As might be expected from her early surroundings, she was more familiar
with Italian. She could both speak and write it.
Indeed, among the verses attributed to her there is
an Italian sonnet addressed to Elizabeth. It is
scarcely credible that she had not read Dante; nevertheless,
it is worthy of notice that his "Divine
Comedy" does not appear in the catalogue of her
library<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
where, however, Petrarch, Boccaccio, and
Ariosto figure by the side of the less-known Bembo.</p>

<p class="indent">Though born in Scotland, Mary Stuart never
possessed great fluency in the language of the
country over which she was called to rule. Her
knowledge of it was acquired chiefly, if not wholly,
after her return from France. Her father, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
whom she might have learnt it in childhood, she
never knew. For her mother the northern Doric
remained through life a foreign tongue. The attendants
with whom she was surrounded in her earliest
infancy were either French or had been educated in
France. It is therefore questionable whether she
could express herself in what was nominally her
native tongue, even when she sailed from Dumbarton
on her journey to the court of the Valois.
That she forgot whatever she may then have
known of it is beyond doubt. Seven years after
she had left France she was still making efforts to
learn English, using translations&mdash;amongst others
an English version of the Psalms&mdash;for the purpose,
but not meeting with signal success. Conversing
with Nicholas White, in 1569, she began with excuses
for "her ill English, declaring herself more
willing than apt to learn the language".<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
It was on the 1st of September of the preceding year that she
wrote what she herself describes as her first letter
in English. This circumstance may warrant its reproduction,
though as an historical document merely,
it possesses no importance. It is addressed to Sir
Francis Knollys: "Mester Knollis, y heuu har sum
neus from Scotland; y send zou the double off them
y vreit to the quin my gud sister, and pres zou to du

</p>

<p class="indent">The testimony of Mary's library,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
to which we have already appealed, and which is the more valuable
and the more trustworthy that the books which
it contained were undoubtedly collected by herself
and for her own use, bears out what has been so
often stated with regard to her love of French literature.
In history it shows her to have been acquainted
not only with the foremost chroniclers;
not only with Froissart, in whose picturesque narrative
her native Scotland is mentioned with such
grateful remembrance of the hospitality shown him;
not only with Monstrelet, from whose ungenerous
treatment of the heroic Joan of Arc she may have
learnt, even before her own experience taught her
the hard lesson, how the animosity of party can
blunt all better feeling; but also with the lesser
writers, with those whose works never reached celebrity
even in their own day and whose names have
long ceased to interest posterity, with Aubert and
Bouchet, Sauvage and Paradin.</p>

<p class="indent">It may be regarded as a proof of her good taste
that she set but little store on the dreary romances
of the time, written either in imitation or in continuation
of "Amadis de Gaul", whilst to Rabelais,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
on the contrary, she accorded the place of honour which he deserved.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
As regards the poets of France, all that Brant&ocirc;me
has told us of her partiality for them finds its justification
in the almost complete collection of their
works which she brought to Scotland with her.
Amongst all others, however, Du Bellay, Maison-Fleur,
and Ronsard were her special favourites.
For the last, in particular, her enthusiasm was unbounded.
It was to the verses in which he embodies
the love of a whole nation that she turned for solace
when the fresh sorrow of her departure from France
was her heaviest burthen; it was over his pages that
her tears flowed in the bitterness which knew no
comfort as she sat a lonely captive in the castles of
Elizabeth. As a token of her admiration she sent
him from her prison a costly service of plate with
the flattering inscription: "A Ronsard, l'Apollon
des Fran&ccedil;ais".<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">It has been asserted by Brant&ocirc;me, and repeated
ever since on his authority, that Mary Stuart herself
excelled in French verse. The elegiac stanzas quoted
by him have been admired in all good faith by succeeding
generations "for the tender pathos of the
sentiments and the original beauty of the metaphors".
It is painful to throw discredit on the
time-honoured tradition, but the late discovery of
a manuscript once in Brant&ocirc;me's possession has
proved, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the
"Elegy on the Death of Francis II" was not composed
by his wife. This was at once established by
Dr. Galy of P&eacute;rigueux, the possessor of the manuscript.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Having since then been favoured by him
with a copy of other poems contained in it and
acknowledged by Brant&ocirc;me as his own productions,
and having compared them carefully with the
"pathetic sentiments" and "original metaphors",
as well as with the expressions and even the rhymes
of the Elegy, we have no hesitation in going a step
further, and pronouncing that the latter is from the
pen of the unscrupulous Lord Abbot himself.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Apart from this, there still remain a few poems attributed
to Mary, and authenticated, not indeed by her signature,
but by what is almost as authoritative, her
anagrams: "Sa vertu m'atire", or "Va, tu meriteras".<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
However interesting these poetical effusions
may be as relics, their literary merit is of no high
order, and they are assuredly not such as to deserve
for the author a place amongst the poets of her
century.</p>

<p class="indent">Before closing our remarks on Mary Stuart's
scholarship and literary acquirements we would dwell
for a moment on the subject of her handwriting, for
that too has been made the subject of admiring
comment by some of her biographers. Con has
recorded that "she formed her letters elegantly and,
what is rare in a woman, wrote swiftly".<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Some reason for his admiration may be found in the fact
that Mary had adopted what Shakespeare styles "the
sweet Roman hand", which at that time was only
beginning to take the place of the old Gothic, and,
in Scotland particularly, had all the charm of a
fashionable novelty. The specimen now before us
shows a bold, rather masculine hand, of such size
that five short words&mdash;"mon linge entre mes
fammes"&mdash;fill a line six inches long. The letters
are seldom joined together, and the words are scattered
over the page with untutored irregularity and
disregard for straight lines. On the whole we cannot
but allow the force of Pepys' exclamation on
being shown some of the Queen's letters: "Lord!
How poorly methinks they wrote in those days, and
on what plain uncut paper!"<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Our sketch of Mary Stuart would not be complete
if we limited ourselves to the more serious
side of her character merely. If she did not deserve
the reputation for utter thoughtlessness and frivolity
which some of her puritanical contemporaries have
given her, she was undoubtedly fond of amusements.
The memoirs and correspondence of the time often
show her seeking recreation in popular sports and
pastimes; indeed, Randolph describes life at the
Scottish Court for the first two years after her return
from France as one continual round of "feasts,
banquetting, masking, and running at the ring, and
such like".<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
It was to Mary, as Knox testifies, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the introduction into Scotland of those primitive dramatic
performances known as Masques or Triumphs
was due. They soon became so popular that they
formed the chief entertainment at every festival.
The Queen herself and her attendants, particularly
the four Marys, often took part in them, either
acting in mere dumb show or reciting the verses
which the elegant pen of Buchanan supplied, and
singing the songs which Rizzio composed, and of
which the melodies may very possibly be those
which, wedded to more modern verse, are still popular
amongst the Scottish peasantry. Not only
were these masques performed in the large halls of
the feudal castles, but in the open air also, near the
little lake at the foot of Arthur's Seat. It may cause
some astonishment at the present day to find not
only the maids of honour, but even the Queen herself,
assuming the dress of the other sex in these
masquerades. Yet the <cite>Diurnal of Occurrents</cite><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
records, without expressing either indignation or even astonishment
at the fact, that "the Queen's Grace
and all her Maries and ladies were all clad in men's
apparel" at the "Maskery or mumschance" given
one Sunday evening in honour of the French Ambassador.</p>

<p class="indent">Like her cousin of England, Mary was fond of
dancing, and, as her Latin biography informs us,
showed to great advantage in it.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
From a passage quaintly noted as "full of diversion" in Sir James
Melville's Memoirs, we learn that the knight being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
pressed by Queen Elizabeth to declare whether she
or his own sovereign danced best, answered her with
courtly ambiguity that "the Queen dancit not so
hich and so disposedly as she did".<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
In reply to the same royal enquirer he also stated that Mary
"sometimes recreated herself in playing upon the
lute and virginals", and that she played "reasonably
for a queen", not so well, however, as Elizabeth
herself.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
We gather from Con<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and Brant&ocirc;me that her voice was well trained, and that she sang well.</p>

<p class="indent">The indoor amusements in favour at Holyrood
were chess, which James VI condemned as "over
wise and philosophic a folly",<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
tables, a game probably resembling backgammon, and cards. That
these last were not played for "love" merely, is
shown by an entry in the Lord Treasurer's accounts
of "fyftie pundis" for Her Majesty "to play at the
cartis".<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Puppets or marionettes were also in great
vogue. A set of thirty-eight, together with a complete
outfit of "vardingaills", "gownis", "kirtillis",
"sairkis slevis", and "hois", is mentioned in an
inventory of the time, where we see these "pippenis"&mdash;an
old Scottish corruption of the French "poupine"&mdash;dressed
in such costly stuffs as damask
brocaded with gold, cloth of silver, and white silk.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Quieter employment for the leisure hours of the
Queen and her ladies was supplied by various kinds
of fancy-work, amongst which knitting and tapestry
are particularly mentioned. To the latter she devoted
much of her time, both at Lochleven, where
she requested to be allowed "an imbroiderer, to
draw forth such work as she would be occupied
about",<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
and in England. Whilst she was at Tutbury,
Nicholas White once asked her how she
passed her time within doors when the weather cut
off all exercises abroad. She replied "that all that
day she wrought with her needle, and that the
diversity of the colours made the work seem less
tedious, and continued so long at it till very pain
made her to give over.... Upon this occasion she
entered into a pretty disputable comparison between
carving, painting, and working with the needle,
affirming painting, in her own opinion, for the most
commendable quality."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">At his interview with Elizabeth, Sir James Melville
was asked what kind of exercises his Queen
used. He answered, that when he received his
dispatch, the Queen was lately come from the
Highland hunting. Her undaunted behaviour on
this occasion is recorded by an eyewitness, Dr.
William Barclay of Gartley, who tells us that she
herself gave the signal for letting the hounds loose
upon a wolf, and that in one day's hunting three
hundred and sixty deer, five wolves, and some wild
goats were slain.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
In common with her father, who took great pains
to introduce "ratches" or greyhounds and bloodhounds
into Scotland, and with her great-grandson,
Charles II, who gave his name to a breed of spaniels,
Mary Stuart shared a great fondness for dogs. In
her happier days she always possessed several, which
she entrusted to the keeping of one Anthone Guedio
and a boy. These canine pets were provided with a
daily ration of two loaves, and wore blue velvet collars
as a distinguishing badge.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
During her captivity, her dogs were amongst her most faithful companions.
Writing from Sheffield to Beton, Archbishop of Glasgow,
she said: "If my uncle, the Cardinal of Guise,
has gone to Lyons, I am sure he will send me a
couple of pretty little dogs, and you will buy me as
many more; for, except reading and working, my
only pleasure is in all the little animals that I can
get. They must be sent in baskets well-packed, so as
to keep them warm."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
The fidelity of one of these
dumb friends adds to the pathos of the last scene
of her sad history. "One of the executioners,"
says a contemporary report, "pulling off her clothes,
espied her little dog which was crept under her
clothes, which would not be gotten forth but by
force, and afterwards would not depart from the
dead body, but came and lay betwixt her head and
shoulders, a thing diligently noted."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
In recording one of his interviews with Queen
Mary, Knox gives us information concerning another
of the sports with which she beguiled her time, for
he tells us that it was at the hawking near Kinross
that she appointed him to meet her.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Archery, too, seems to have been a favourite amusement. She
had butts both at Holyrood and St. Andrews.
Writing to Cecil in 1562, and again in 1567, Randolph
informs him that the Queen and the Master
of Lindsay shot against Mary Livingston and the
Earl of Murray; and that, in another match, the
Queen and Bothwell won a dinner at Tranent from
the Earl of Huntley and Lord Seton.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Neither did she neglect the "royal game", for one of the charges
brought against her and embodied in the articles
given in by the Earl of Murray to Queen Elizabeth's
commissioners at Westminster, stated that
a few days after Darnley's murder "she past to
Seytoun, exercing hir one day richt oppinlie at the
feildis with the pallmall and goif".</p>

<p class="indent">To sketch Mary's character further would be
trenching on debatable ground and overstepping
the limits which we have imposed upon ourselves.
There is one trait, however, which may be recorded
on the authority even of her enemies&mdash;her personal
courage. Randolph represents her as riding at the
head of her troops "with a steel bonnet on her
head, and a pistol at her saddle-bow; regretting that
she was not a man to know what life it was to lie
all night in the fields, or to walk upon the causeway
with a jack and a knapscull, a Glasgow buckler,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and a broadsword". The author of the poem
preserved in the Record Office, to which we have
already made reference, allows that "no enemy
could appal her, no travail daunt her intent", that
she "dreaded no danger of death", that "no stormy
blasts could make her retire", and he likens her to
Tomiris:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">Tomiris hir selffe</span>
<span class="i0">Who dreaded (<em>awed</em>) great hosts with her tyrannye</span>
<span class="i0">Cold not showe hir selffe more valiant.</span>

<p class="indent">But never, surely, was her fortitude shown more
clearly to the world than when, three hundred years
ago, "she laid herself upon the block most quietly,
trying her chin over it, stretching out her hands,
and crying out: 'In manus tuas, Domine, commendo
spiritum meum'".</p>

<h2>THE FOUR MARYS</h2>

<p class="indent">Reference is seldom made to the Queen's Marys,
the four Maids of Honour whose romantic attachment
to their royal mistress and namesake, the ill-fated
Queen of Scots, has thrown such a halo of
popularity and sympathy about their memory, without
calling forth the well-known lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Yestreen the Queen had four Maries,</span>
<span class="i4">The night she'll hae but three;</span>
<span class="i0">There was Marie Seton, and Marie Beton,</span>
<span class="i4">And Marie Carmichael and me.</span>
</div></div>

<p>To those who are acquainted with the whole of the
ballad, which records the sad fate of the guilty Mary
Hamilton, it must have occurred that there is a
striking incongruity between the traditional loyalty
of the Queen's Marys and the alleged execution of
one of their number, on the denunciation of the
offended Queen herself, for the murder of an illegitimate
child, the reputed offspring of a criminal
intrigue with Darnley. Yet a closer investigation
of the facts assumed in the ballad leads to a discovery
more unexpected than even this. It establishes,
beyond the possibility of a doubt, that, of the
four family-names given in the stanza as those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the four Marys, two only are authentic. Mary
Carmichael and Mary Hamilton herself are mere
poetical myths. Not only does no mention of them
occur in any of the lists still extant of the Queen's
personal attendants, but there also exist documents
of all kinds, from serious historical narrative and
authoritative charter to gossiping correspondence
and polished epigram, to prove that the colleagues
of Mary Beton and Mary Seton were Mary Fleming
and Mary Livingston. How the apocryphal names
have found their way into the ballad, or how the
ballad itself has come to be connected with the
Maids of Honour, cannot be determined. There
is, however, in Knox's <cite>History of the Reformation</cite>,
a passage which has been looked upon as furnishing
a possible foundation of truth to the whole
fiction. It is that in which he records the commission
and the punishment of a crime similar to
that for which Mary Hamilton is represented as
about to die on the gallows. "In the very time of
the General Assembly there comes to public knowledge
a haynous murther, committed in the Court;
yea, not far from the queen's lap: for a French
woman, that served in the queen's chamber, had
played the whore with the queen's own apothecary.
The woman conceived and bare a child, whom with
common consent, the father and mother murthered;
yet were the cries of a new-borne childe hearde,
searche was made, the childe and the mother were
both apprehended, and so was the man and the
woman condemned to be hanged in the publicke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
street of Edinburgh. The punishment was suitable,
because the crime was haynous."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Between this historical fact&mdash;for the authenticity of which we have
also the testimony of Randolph<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
&mdash;and the ballad, which substitutes Darnley and one of the Maids of
Honour for the queen's apothecary and a nameless
waiting-woman, the connection is not very close.
Indeed, there is but one point on which both
accounts are in agreement, though that, it is true,
is an important one. The unnatural mother whose
crime, with its condign punishment, is mentioned by
the historian, was, he says, a French woman. The
Mary Hamilton of the ballad, in spite of a name
which certainly does not point to a foreign origin,
is also made to come from over the seas:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">I charge ye all, ye mariners,</span>
<span class="i4">When ye sail ower the faem;</span>
<span class="i0">Let neither my father nor my mother get wit</span>
<span class="i4">But that I'm coming hame.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">O, little did my mother ken,</span>
<span class="i4">The day she cradled me,</span>
<span class="i0">The lands I was to travel in,</span>
<span class="i4">Or the death I was to dee.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
It does not, however, come within the scope of
the present paper to examine more closely into the
ballad of Mary Hamilton. It suffices to have made
it clear that, whatever be their origin, the well-known
verses have no historical worth or significance, and
no real claim to the title of "The Queen's Marie"
prefixed to them in the <cite>Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Except for the purpose of correcting the
erroneous, but general belief, which has been propagated
by the singular and altogether unwarranted
mention of the "Four Marys", and the introduction
of the names of two of them in the oft-quoted
stanza, there would, in reality, be no necessity for
any allusion to the popular poem in a sketch of the
career of the fair Maids of Honour, whose touching
fidelity through good and evil fortune has won for
them a greater share of interest than is enjoyed by
any of the subordinate characters in the great historical
drama of which their royal mistress is the
central figure.</p>

<p class="indent">The first historical and authoritative mention of
the four Marys is from the pen of one who was
personally and intimately acquainted with them&mdash;John
Leslie, Bishop of Ross. It occurs in his description
of the departure of the infant Mary Stuart
from the small harbour at the foot of the beetling,
castle-crowned rock of Dumbarton, on that memorable
voyage which so nearly resembled a flight. "All
things being reddy for the jornay," writes the chronicler,
in his quaint northern idiom, "the Quene being
as than betuix fyve and sax yearis of aige, wes delivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to the quene dowarier hir moder, and wes

the Lord Erskyn and Lord Levingstoun quha had

quho remainit all foure with the Quene in France,
during her residens thair, and returned agane in
Scotland with her Majestie in the yeir of our Lord
I<sup>m</sup>V<sup>c</sup>lxi yeris."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Of the education and early training
of the four Marys, as companions and playmates of
the youthful queen, we have no special record. The
deficiency is one which our knowledge of the wild
doings of the gayest court of the age makes it easy
to supply. For the Scottish maidens, as for their
mistress, intercourse with the frivolous company that
gathered about Catherine de' Medici was but indifferent
preparation for the serious business of life.
Looking back on "those French years", doubtless
they too, like her, "only seemed to see&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A light of swords and singing, only hear</span>
<span class="i0">Laughter of love and lovely stress of lutes,</span>
<span class="i0">And in between the passion of them borne</span>
<span class="i0">Sound of swords crossing ever, as of feet</span>
<span class="i0">Dancing, and life and death still equally</span>
<span class="i0">Blithe and bright-eyed from battle."</span>
</div></div>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Brant&ocirc;me, to whom we are indebted for so much
personal description of Mary Stuart, and so many
intimate details concerning her character, tastes, and
acquirements, is less communicative with respect to
her four fair attendants. He merely mentions them
amongst the court beauties as "Mesdamoiselles de
Flammin, de Ceton, Beton, Leviston, escoissaises".<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
He makes no allusion to them in the pathetic description
of the young queen's departure from her
"sweet France" on the fateful 24th of August, a
date which subsequent events were destined to mark
with a fearful stain of blood, in the family to which
she was allied. Yet, doubtless they, too, were gazing
with tearful eyes at the receding shore, blessing the
calm which retarded their course, trembling with
vague fears as their voyage began amidst the cries
of drowning men, and half wishing that the English
ships of the jealous Elizabeth might prevent them
from reaching their dreary destination. That they
were with their royal namesake, we know. Leslie,
who, with Brant&ocirc;me and the unfortunate Chastelard,
accompanied the idol of France to her unsympathetic
northern home, again makes special note of "the
four maidis of honour quha passit with hir Hienes
in France, of her awin aige, bering the name everie
ane of Marie, as is befoir mencioned".</p>

<p class="indent">During the first years of Mary Stuart's stay in
her capital, the four maids of honour played conspicuous
parts in all the amusements and festivities
of the court, and were amongst those who incurred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the censure of the austere Reformers for introducing
into Holyrood the "balling, and dancing, and banquetting"<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
of Amboise and Fontainbleau. Were our
information about the masques acted at the Scottish
Court less scanty, we should, doubtless, often find the
names of the four Marys amongst the performers.
Who more fit than they to figure in the first masque
represented at Holyrood, in October, 1561, at the
Queen's farewell banquet to her uncle, the Grand
Prior of the Knights of St. John, and to take their
places amongst the Muses who marched in procession
before the throne, reciting Buchanan's flattering verses
in praise of the lettered court of the Queen of Scots?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Banished by War, to thee we take our flight,</span>
<span class="i2">Who still dost worship at the Muses' shrine,</span>
<span class="i0">And, solaced by thy presence, day and night,</span>
<span class="i2">Nor murmur at our exile, nor repine.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Had Marioreybanks given us the names of those
who took part in the festivities which he describes
as having taken place on the occasion of Lord Fleming's
marriage, can we doubt that the Marys would
have been found actively engaged in the open-air
performance "in the Parke of Holyroudhous, under
Arthur's Seatt, at the end of the loche"?<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Indeed, it is not matter of mere conjecture, but of authentic
historical record, that on more than one occasion
Buchanan did actually introduce the Queen's namesakes
amongst the dramatis person&aelig; of the masques
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
which, as virtual laureate of the Scottish Court, he
was called upon to supply. The <cite>Diurnal of Occurrents</cite>
mentions that "upoun the ellevint day
of the said moneth (February) the King and Quene
in lyik manner bankettit the samin (French) Ambassatour;
and at evin our Soveranis maid the maskrie
and mumschance, in the quhilk the Queenis Grace
and all hir Maries and ladies were all cled in men's
apperell; and everie ane of thame presentit ane
quhingar, bravelie and maist artificiallie made and
embroiderit with gold, to the said Ambassatour and
his gentilmen, everie ane of thame according to his
estate".<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> That this, moreover, was not the first
appearance of the fair performers we also know, for
it was they who bore the chief parts in the third
masque acted during the festivities which attended
the Queen's marriage with Darnley; and it was one
of them, perhaps Mary Beton, the scholar of the
court, who recited the verses which Buchanan had
introduced in allusion to their royal mistress's recovery
from some illness otherwise unrecorded in
history:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kind Goddess, Health, four Nymphs their voices raise</span>
<span class="i0">To welcome thy return and sing thy praise,</span>
<span class="i0">To beg as suppliants that thou wouldst deign</span>
<span class="i0">To smile benignly on their Queen again,</span>
<span class="i0">And make her royal breast thy hallowed shrine,</span>
<span class="i0">Where best and worthiest worship shall be thine.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">That the four Nymphs mentioned in this, the only
fragment of the masque which has been preserved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
were the four Marys, is explained by Buchanan's
commentator, Ruddiman: "Nymphas his vocat
quatuor Mari&aelig; Scot&aelig; corporis ministras, qu&aelig; etiam
omnes Mari&aelig; nominabantur". It is more than probable,
too, that the Marys were not merely spectators
of the masque which formed a part of the first day's
amusements, and of which they themselves were the
subject-matter. It may still be read under the title of
"Pompa Deorum in Nuptiis Mari&aelig;", in Buchanan's
Latin poems. Diana opens the masque, which is but
a short mythological dialogue, with a complaint to
the ruler of Olympus that one of her five Marys&mdash;the
Queen herself is here included&mdash;has been taken
from her by the envious arts of Venus and of Juno:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Five Marys erst my boast and glory were,</span>
<span class="i0">Each one in youthful beauty passing fair;</span>
<span class="i0">Whilst these enhanced the splendour of my state</span>
<span class="i0">To all the gods I seemed too fortunate,</span>
<span class="i0">Till Venus, urged by Juno in her ire,</span>
<span class="i0">Stole one away and marred my comely quire,</span>
<span class="i0">Whereof the other four now grieve that they</span>
<span class="i0">Must, like the Pleiads, shine with lessened ray.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">In the dialogue which follows, and in which five
goddesses and five gods take part, Apollo chimes
in with a prophecy which was only partially accomplished:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fear not, Diana, cast away thy care,</span>
<span class="i0">And hear the tidings which I prescient bear;</span>
<span class="i0">Juno decrees thy Marys shall be wed,</span>
<span class="i0">And in all state to Hymen's altar led,</span>
<span class="i0">But each to fill its lessened ranks again,</span>
<span class="i0">Will add her offspring to thy beauteous train.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
In his summing up, which, as may be imagined,
is not very favourable to the complainant, the
Olympian judge also introduces a prettily turned
compliment to the Marys:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Five Marys erst were thine and each one meet</span>
<span class="i0">With goddesses in beauty to compete;</span>
<span class="i0">Each worthy of a god, if iron fate</span>
<span class="i0">Allowed the gods to choose a mortal mate.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The whole pageant closes with an epilogue spoken
by the herald Talthybius, who also foretells further
defections from Diana's maidens:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Another marriage! Hear the joyful cry:</span>
<span class="i0">Another Mary joined in nuptial tie!</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">As was but natural, the Queen's favourite attendants
possessed considerable influence with their royal
lady, and the sequel will show, in the case of each
of them, how eagerly their good offices were sought
after by courtiers and ambassadors anxious for the
success of their several suits and missions. In a
letter which Randolph wrote to Cecil on the 24th of
October, 1564, and which, as applying to the Marys
collectively, may be quoted here, we are shown the
haughty Lennox himself condescending to make
pretty presents to the maids with a view to ingratiating
himself with the mistress. "He presented
also each of the Marys with such pretty
things as he thought fittest for them, such good
means he hath to win their hearts, and to make
his way to further effect."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>

<h2>MARY FLEMING</h2>

<p class="indent">It is scarcely the result of mere chance that, in the
chronicles which make mention of the four Marys,
Mary Fleming's name usually takes precedence of
those of her three colleagues. She seems to have
been tacitly recognized as "prima inter pares".
This was, doubtless, less in consequence of her belonging
to one of the first houses in Scotland, for
the Livingstons, the Betons, and the Setons might
well claim equality with the Flemings, than of her
being closely related to Mary Stuart herself, though
the relationship, it is true, was only on the side of
the distaff, and though there was, moreover, a bar
sinister on the royal quarterings which it added to
the escutcheon of the Flemings. Mary Fleming&mdash;Marie
Flemyng, as she signed herself, or Flamy, as
she was called in the Queen's broken English&mdash;was
the fourth daughter of Malcolm, third Lord Fleming.
Her mother, Janet Stuart, was a natural daughter of
King James IV. Mary Fleming and her royal mistress
were consequently first cousins. This may
sufficiently account for the greater intimacy which
existed between them. Thus, after Chastelard's
outrage, it was Mary Fleming whom the Queen,
dreading the loneliness which had rendered the wild
attempt possible, called in to sleep with her, for protection.</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Amongst the various festivities and celebrations
which were revived in Holyrood by Mary and the
suite which she had brought with her from the gay
court of France, that of Twelfth Night seems to
have been in high favour, as, indeed, it still is in
some provinces of France at the present day. In
the "g&acirc;teau des Rois", or Twelfth Night Cake, it
was customary to hide a bean, and when the cake
was cut up and distributed, the person to whom
chance&mdash;or not infrequently design&mdash;brought the
piece containing the bean, was recognized sole
monarch of the revels until the stroke of midnight.
On the 6th of January, 1563, Mary Fleming was
elected queen by favour of the bean. Her mistress,
entering into the spirit of the festivities, with her
characteristic considerateness for even the amusement
of those about her, abdicated her state in
favour of the mimic monarch of the night. A letter
written by Randolph to Lord Dudley, and bearing
the date of the 15th of January, gives an interesting
and vivid picture of the fair maid of honour decked
out in her royal mistress's jewels: "You should have
seen here upon Tuesday the great solemnity and
royall estate of the Queen of the Beene. Fortune
was so favourable to faire Flemyng, that, if shee
could have seen to have judged of her vertue and
beauty, as blindly she went to work and chose her at
adventure, shee would sooner have made her Queen
for ever, then for one night only, to exalt her so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
high and the nixt to leave her in the state she found
her.... That day yt was to be seen, by her princely
pomp, how fite a match she would be, wer she to
contend ether with Venus in beauty, Minerva in
witt, or Juno in worldly wealth, haveing the two
former by nature, and of the third so much as is
contained in this realme at her command and free
disposition. The treasure of Solomon, I trowe, was
not to be compared unto that which hanged upon
her back.... The Queen of the Beene was in a
gowne of cloath of silver; her head, her neck, her
shoulders, the rest of her whole body, so besett with
stones, that more in our whole jewell house wer not
to be found. The Queen herself was apparelled in
collours whyt and black, no other jewell or gold
about her bot the ring that I brought her from the
Queen's Majestie hanging at her breast, with a lace
of whyt and black about her neck." In another
part of the same letter the writer becomes even
more enthusiastic: "Happy was it unto this realm,"
he says, "that her reign endured no longer. Two
such nights in one state, in so good accord, I
believe was never seen, as to behold two worthy
queens possess, without envy, one kingdom, both
upon a day. I leave the rest to your lordship to be
judged of. My pen staggereth, my hand faileth,
further to write.... The cheer was great. I never
found myself so happy, nor so well treated, until
that it came to the point that the old queen herself,
to show her mighty power, contrary unto the assurance
granted me by the younger queen, drew me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
into the dance, which part of the play I could with
good will have spared to your lordship, as much
fitter for the purpose."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The queen of this Twelfth-Tide pageant was also
celebrated by the court poet Buchanan. Amongst
his epigrams there is one bearing the title: "Ad
Mariam Flaminiam sorte Reginam":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Could worth or high descent a crown bestow,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hadst been Queen, fair Fleming, long ago;</span>
<span class="i0">Were grace and beauty titles to the throne,</span>
<span class="i0">No grace or beauty had outshone thine own;</span>
<span class="i0">Did vows of mortal men avail with Fate,</span>
<span class="i0">Our vows had raised thee to the royal state.</span>
<span class="i0">The fickle Deity that rules mankind,</span>
<span class="i0">Though blind and deaf and foolish in her mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed neither foolish, deaf, nor blind to be</span>
<span class="i0">When regal honours she accorded thee;</span>
<span class="i0">Or, if she were, then 'twas by Virtue led</span>
<span class="i0">She placed the diadem upon thy head.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The "Faire Flemyng" found an admirer amongst
the English gentlemen whom political business had
brought to the Scotch Court. This was Sir Henry
Sidney, of whom Naunton reports that he was a
statesman "of great parts". As Sir Henry was
born in 1519, and consequently over twenty years
older than the youthful maid of honour, his choice
cannot be considered to have been a very judicious
one, nor can the ill-success of his suit appear greatly
astonishing. And yet, as the sequel was to show,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Mary Fleming had no insuperable objection to an
advantageous match on the score of disparity of
age. In the year following that in which she figured
as Queen of the Bean at Holyrood, the gossiping
correspondence of the time expatiates irreverently
enough on Secretary Maitland's wooing of the maid
of honour. He was about forty at the time, and
it was not very long since his first wife, Janet Monteith,
had died. Mary Fleming was about two-and-twenty.
There was, consequently, some show of
reason for the remark made by Kirkcaldy of Grange,
in communicating to Randolph the new matrimonial
project in which Maitland was embarked: "The
Secretary's wife is dead, and he is a suitor to Mary
Fleming, who is as meet for him as I am to be a
page".<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Cecil appears to have been taken into the
Laird of Lethington's confidence, and doubtless found
amusement in the enamoured statesman's extravagance.
"The common affairs do never so much
trouble me but that at least I have one merry hour
of the four-and-twenty.... Those that be in love
are ever set upon a merry pin; yet I take this to
be a most singular remedy for all diseases in all
persons."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
Two of the keenest politicians of their age
laying aside their diplomatic gravity and forgetting
the jealousies and the rivalry of their respective courts
to discuss the charms of the Queen's youthful maid
of honour: it is a charming historical vignette not
without interest and humour even at this length of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
time. We may judge to what extent the Secretary
was "set on a merry pin", from Randolph's description
of the courtship. In a letter dated 31 March,
1565, and addressed to Sir Henry Sidney, Mary
Fleming's old admirer, he writes: "She neither remembereth
you, nor scarcely acknowledgeth that
you are her man. Your lordship, therefore, need
not to pride you of any such mistress in this court;
she hath found another whom she doth love better.
Lethington now serveth her alone, and is like, for
her sake, to run beside himself. Both night and
day he attendeth, he watcheth, he wooeth&mdash;his folly
never more apparent than in loving her, where he
may be assured that, how much soever he make of
her, she will always love another better. This much
I have written for the worthy praise of your noble
mistress, who, now being neither much worth in
beauty, nor greatly to be praised in virtue, is content,
in place of lords and earls, to accept to her
service a poor pen clerk."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
We have not to reconcile the ill-natured and slanderous remarks of Randolph's
letter with the glowing panegyric penned by him
some two years previously. That he intended to
comfort the rejected suitor, and to tone down the
disappointment and the jealousy which he might feel
at the success of a rival not greatly younger than
himself, would be too charitable a supposition. It is
not improbable that he may have had more personal
reasons for his spite, and that when, in the same
letter, he describes "Fleming that once was so fair",
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
wishing "with many a sigh that Randolph had served
her", he is giving a distorted and unscrupulous version
of an episode not unlike that between Mary
Fleming and Sir Henry himself. To give even the
not very high-minded Randolph his due, however,
it is but fair to add that his later letters, whilst fully
bearing out what he had previously stated with regard
to Maitland's lovemaking, throw no doubt on
Mary's sincerity: "Lethington hath now leave and
time to court his mistress, Mary Fleming";<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
and, again, "My old friend, Lethington, hath leisure to
make love; and, in the end, I believe, as wise as he
is, will show himself a very fool, or stark, staring
mad".<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
This "leisure to make love" is attributed
to Rizzio, then in high favour with the Queen.
This was about the end of 1565. Early in 1566,
however, the unfortunate Italian was murdered
under circumstances too familiar to need repetition,
and for his share in the unwarrantable transaction,
Secretary Maitland was banished from the royal
presence. The lovers were, in consequence, parted
for some six months, from March to September.
It was about this time that Queen Mary, dreading
the hour of her approaching travail, and haunted
by a presentiment that it would prove fatal to her,
caused inventories of her private effects to be drawn
up, and made legacies to her personal friends and
attendants. The four Marys were not forgotten.
They were each to receive a diamond; "Aux
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
quatre Maries, quatre autres petis diamants de diverse
fa&ccedil;on",<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
besides a portion of the Queen's needlework
and linen: "tous mes ouurasges, manches et
collets aux quatre Maries".<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
In addition to this, there was set down for "Flamy", two pieces of
gold lace with ornaments of white and red enamel,
a dress, a necklace, and a chain to be used as a
girdle. We may infer that red and white were the
maid of honour's favourite colours, for "blancq et
rouge" appear in some form or another in all the
items of the intended legacy.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">As we have said, the Secretary's disgrace was
not of long duration. About September he was
reinstated in the Queen's favour, and in December
received from her a dress of cloth of gold trimmed
with silver lace: "Une vasquyne de toille d'or plaine
auecq le corps de mesme fait a bourletz borde dung
passement dargent".<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
On the 6th of January, 1567, William Maitland
of Lethington and Mary Fleming were married at
Stirling, where the Queen was keeping her court,
and where she spent the last Twelfth-Tide she was
to see outside the walls of a prison. The Secretary's
wife, as Mary was frequently styled after her marriage,
did not cease to be in attendance upon her royal
cousin, and we get occasional glimpses of her in the
troubled times which were to follow. Thus, on the
eventful morning on which Bothwell's trial began,
Mary Fleming stood with the Queen at the window
from which the latter, after having imprudently refused
an audience to the Provost-Marshal of Berwick,
Elizabeth's messenger, still more imprudently watched
the bold Earl's departure and, it was reported, smiled
and nodded encouragement. Again, in the enquiry
which followed the Queen's escape from Lochleven,
it appeared that her cousin had been privy to the plot
for her release, and had found the means of conveying
to the royal captive the assurance that her friends
were working for her deliverance: "The Queen", so
ran the evidence of one of the attendants examined
after the flight, "said scho gat ane ring and three
wordis in Italianis in it. I iudget it cam fra the
Secretar, because of the language. Scho said, 'Na, ...
it was ane woman. All the place saw hir weyr it.
Cursall show me the Secretaris wiff send it, and
the vreting of it was ane fable of Isop betuix the
Mouss and the Lioune, hou the Mouss for ane
plesour done to hir be the Lioune, efter that, the
Lioune being bound with ane corde, the Mouss
schuyr the corde and let the Lioune louss.'"<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">During her long captivity in England, the unfortunate
Queen was not unmindful of the love
and devotion of her faithful attendant. Long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
years after she had been separated from her, whilst
in prison at Sheffield, she gives expression to her
longing for the presence of Mary Fleming, and in
a letter written "du manoir de Sheffield", on the
1st of May, 1581, to Monsieur de Mauvissi&eacute;re, the
French ambassador, she begs him to renew her request
to Elizabeth that the Lady of Lethington
should be allowed to tend her in "the valetudinary
state into which she has fallen, of late years, owing
to the bad treatment to which she has been subjected".<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">But the Secretary's wife had had her own trials
and her own sorrows. On the 9th of June, 1573,
her husband died at Leith, "not without suspicion
of poison", according to Killigrew. Whether he
died by his own hand, or by the act of his enemies,
is a question which we are not called upon to discuss.
The evidence of contemporaries is conflicting,
"some supponyng he tak a drink and died as the
auld Romans wer wont to do", as Sir James Melville
reports;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
others, and amongst these Queen Mary
herself, that he had been foully dealt with. Writing
to Elizabeth, she openly gives expression to this belief:
"the principal (of the rebel lords) were besieged
by your forces in the Castle of Edinburgh, and one
of the first among them poisoned".</p>

<p class="indent">Maitland was to have been tried "for art and part
of the treason, conspiracy, consultation, and treating
of the King's murder". According to the law of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Scotland, a traitor's guilt was not cancelled by death.
The corpse might be arraigned and submitted to all
the indignities which the barbarous code of the age
recognized as the punishment of treason. It was
intended to inflict the fullest penalty upon Maitland's
corpse, and it remained unburied "till the vermin
came from his corpse, creeping out under the door
of the room in which he was lying".<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
In her distress the widow applied to Burleigh, in a touching
letter which is still preserved. It bears the date of the 21st of June, 1573.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
My very good Lord,&mdash;After my humble commendations,
it may please your Lordship that the causes of the sorrowful
widow, and orphants, by Almighty God recommended to
the superior powers, together with the firm confidence my
late husband, the Laird of Ledington, put in your Lordship's
only help is the occasion, that I his desolat wife (though unknown
to your Lordship), takes the boldness by these few
lines, to humblie request your Lordship, that as my said husband
being alive expected no small benefit at your hands, so
now I may find such comfort, that the Queen's Majestie,
your Sovereign, may by your travell and means be moved to
write to my Lord Regent of Scotland, that the body of my
husband, which when alive has not been spared in her hieness'
service, may now, after his death, receive no shame, or
ignominy, and that his heritage taken from him during his lifetime,
now belonging to me and his children, that have not
offended, by a disposition made a long time ago, may be restored,
which is aggreeable both to equity and the laws of this
realme; and also your Lordship will not forget my husband's
brother, the Lord of Coldingham, ane innocent gentleman,
who was never engaged in these quarrels, but for his love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
to his brother, accompanied him, and is now a prisoner with
the rest, that by your good means, and procurement, he may
be restored to his own, by doing whereof, beside the blessing
of God, your lordship will also win the goodwill of many
noblemen and gentlemen.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Burleigh lost no time in laying the widow's petition
before Elizabeth, and on the 19th of July a letter
written at Croydon was dispatched to the Regent
Morton: "For the bodie of Liddington, who died
before he was convict in judgment, and before any
answer by him made to the crymes objected to him,
it is not our maner in this contrey to show crueltey
upon the dead bodies so unconvicted, but to suffer
them streight to be buried, and put in the earth.
And so suerly we think it mete to be done in this
case, for (as we take it) it was God's pleasure he
should be taken away from the execucion of judgment,
so we think consequently that it was His divine
pleasure that the bodie now dead should not be lacerated,
nor pullid in pieces, but be buried like to one
who died in his bed, and by sicknes, as he did."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Such a petitioner as the Queen of England was
not to be denied, and Maitland's body was allowed
the rites of burial. The other penalties which he
had incurred by his treason&mdash;real or supposed&mdash;were
not remitted. An Act of Parliament was passed
"for rendering the children, both lawful and natural,
of Sir William Maitland of Lethington, the younger,
and of several others, who had been convicted of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
murder of the King's father, incapable of enjoying,
or claiming, any heritages, lands, or possessions in
Scotland".</p>

<p class="indent">The widow herself was also subjected to petty
annoyances at the instigation of Morton. She was
called upon to restore the jewels which her royal
mistress had given her as a free gift, and in particular,
"one chayn of rubeis with twelf markes of dyamontis
and rubeis, and ane mark with twa rubeis".<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Even her own relatives seemed to have turned
against her in her distress. In a letter written in
French to her sister-in-law, Isabel, wife of James
Heriot of Trabroun, she refers to some accusation
brought against her by her husband's brother,
Coldingham&mdash;the same for whom she had interceded
in her letter to Burleigh&mdash;and begs to be
informed as to the nature of the charge made to
the Regent, "car ace que jantans il me charge de
quelque chose, je ne say que cest".<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
The letter bears no date, but seems to have been penned
when the writer's misery was at its sorest, for it
concludes with an earnest prayer that patience may
be given her to bear the weight of her misfortunes.</p>

<p class="indent">Better days, however, were yet in store for the
much-tried Mary Fleming, for in February, 1584,
the "relict of umquhill William Maitland, younger
of Lethington, Secretare to our Soverane Lord",
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
succeeded in obtaining a reversion of her husband's
forfeiture. In May of the same year,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
the Parliament allowed "Marie Flemyng and hir bairns to
have bruik and inioy the same and like fauour,
grace and priuilege and conditioun as is contenit in
the pacificatioun maid and accordit at Perthe, the
xxiii day of Februar, the yeir of God I<sup>m</sup> V<sup>c</sup> lxxxij
yeiris".</p>

<p class="indent">With this document one of the four Marys disappears
from the scene. Of her later life we have
no record. That it was thoroughly happy we can
scarcely assume, for we know that her only son
James died in poverty and exile.</p>

<h2>MARY LIVINGSTON</h2>

<p class="indent">Mary Livingston, or, as she signed herself, Marie
Leuiston, was the daughter of Alexander, fifth Lord
Livingston. She was a cousin of Mary Fleming's,
and, like her, related, though more distantly, to the
sovereign. When she sailed from Scotland in 1548,
as one of the playmates of the infant Mary Stuart,
she was accompanied by both her father and her
mother. Within a few years, however, she was
left to the sole care of the latter, Lord Livingston
having died in France in 1553. Of her life at the
French Court we have no record. Her first appearance
in the pages of contemporary chroniclers is on
the 22nd of April, 1562, the year after her return
to Scotland. On that date, the young Queen, who
delighted in the sport of archery, shot off a match
in her private gardens at St. Andrews. Her own
partner was the Master of Lindsay.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Their opponents were the Earl of Moray, then only Earl
of Mar, and Mary Livingston, whose skill is reported
to have been&mdash;when courtesy allowed it&mdash;quite
equal to that of her royal mistress.</p>

<p class="indent">The next item of information is to be found in
the matter-of-fact columns of an account book, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
which we find it entered that the Queen gave Mary
Livingston some grey damask for a gown, in September,
1563,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and some black velvet for the same
purpose in the following February.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Shortly after this, however, there occurred an event of greater
importance, which supplied the letter-writers of the
day with material for their correspondence. On the
5th of March, 1564, Mary Livingston was married
to James Sempill, of Beltreis. It was the first marriage
amongst the Marys, and consequently attracted
considerable attention for months before the celebration.
As early as January, Paul de Foix, the French
Ambassador, makes allusion to the approaching event:
"Elle a commenc&eacute; &agrave; marier ses quatre Maries", he
writes to Catharine de' Medici, "et dict qu'elle veult
estre de la bande".<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
In a letter, dated the 9th of the
same month, Randolph, faithful to his habit of communicating
all the gossip of the Court in his reports
to England, informs Bedford of the intended marriage:
"I learned yesterday that there is a conspiracy here
framed against you. The matter is this: the Lord
Sempill's son, being an Englishman born, shall be
married between this and Shrovetide to the Lord
Livingston's sister. The Queen, willing him well,
both maketh the marriage and indoweth the parties
with land. To do them honour she will have them
marry in the Court. The thing intended against your
lordship is this, that Sempill himself shall come
to Berwicke within these fourteen days, and desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
you to be at the bridal."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Writing to Leicester, he repeats his information: "It will not be above
6 or 7 days before the Queen (returning from her
progress into Fifeshire) will be in this town. Immediately
after that ensueth the great marriage of
this happy Englishman that shall marry lovely
Livingston."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Finally, on the 4th of March, he
again writes: "Divers of the noblemen have come
to this great marriage, which to-morrow shall be
celebrated".<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Randolph's epistolary garrulity has,
in this instance, served one good purpose, of which
he probably little dreamt when he filled his correspondence
with the small talk of the Court circle. It
enables us to refute a calumnious assertion made by
John Knox with reference to the marriage of the
Queen's maid of honour. "It was weill knawin that
schame haistit mariage betwix John Sempill, callit
the Danser, and Marie Levingstoune, surnameit the
Lustie."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Randolph's first letter, showing, as it
does, that preparations for the wedding were in
progress as early as the beginning of January, summarily
dismisses the charge of "haste" in its celebration,
whilst, for those who are familiar with the
style of the English envoy's correspondence, his
very silence will appear the strongest proof that
Mary's fair fame was tarnished by no breath of
scandal. The birth of her first child in 1566, a
fact to which the family records of the house of
Sempill bear witness, establishes more irrefutably
than any argument the utter falsity of Knox's unscrupulous
assertion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">John Sempill, whose grace in dancing had acquired
for him the surname which seems to have lain so
heavily on Knox's conscience, and whose good fortune
in finding favour with lovely Mary Livingston
called forth Randolph's congratulations, was the eldest
son of the third lord, by his second wife Elizabeth
Carlyle of Torthorwold. At Court, as may have been
gathered from Randolph's letters, he was known as
the "Englishman", owing to the fact of his having
been born in Newcastle. Although of good family
himself, and in high favour at Court, being but a
younger son he does not seem to have been considered
on all hands as a fitting match for Mary
Livingston. This the Queen, of whose making
the marriage was, herself confesses in a letter to
the Archbishop of Glasgow, reminding him that,
"in a country where these formalities were looked
to", exception had been taken to the marriage both
of Mary and Magdalene Livingston on the score
that they had taken as husbands "the younger sons
of their peers&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les pu&icirc;n&eacute;s de leurs semblables</i>".<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
Mary Stuart seems to have been above such prejudices, and
showed how heartily she approved of the alliance
between the two families by her liberality to the
bride. Shortly before the marriage she gave her a
band covered with pearls, a basquina of grey satin,
a mantle of black taffety made in the Spanish fashion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
with silver buttons, and also a gown of black taffety.
It was she, too, who furnished the bridal dress, which
cost &pound;30, as entered in the accounts under date of
the 10th of March:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Item: Ane pund xiii unce of silver to ane gown of Marie
Levingstoune's to her mariage, the unce xxv s. Summa
xxx li.</p>

<p class="indent">The "Inuentair of the Quenis movables quhilkis
ar in the handes of Seruais de Condy vallett of
chalmer to hir Grace", records, further, that there
was "deliueret in Merche 1564, to Johnne Semples
wiff, ane bed of scarlett veluot bordit with broderie
of black veluot, furnisit with ruif heidpece, thre
pandis, twa vnderpandis, thre curtenis of taffetie
of the same cullour without freingis. The bed is
furnisit with freingis of the same cullour." To
make her gift complete, the Queen, as another
household document, her wardrobe book, testifies,
added the following items:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Item: Be the said precept to Marie Levingstoun xxxi elnis
ii quarters of quhite fustiane to be ane marterass,
the eln viii s. Summa xii li xii s.<br />
Item: xvi elnis of cammes to be palzeass, the eln vi s. Summa iiij li xvj s.<br />
Item: For nappes and fedders; v li.<br />
Item: Ane elne of lane; xxx s.<br />
Item: ij unce of silk; xx s.
</p>

<p class="indent">The wedding for which such elaborate preparation
had been made, and for which the Queen herself
named the day, took place, in the presence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the whole Court and all the foreign ambassadors,
on Shrove Tuesday, which, as has already been
mentioned, was on the 5th of March. In the
evening the wedding guests were entertained at a
masque, which was supplied by the Queen, but of
which we know nothing further than may be gathered
from the following entry:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">Item: To the painter for the mask on Fastionis evin to
Marie Levingstoun's marriage; xij li.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The marriage contract, which was signed at Edinburgh
on the Sunday preceding the wedding, bears
the names of the Queen, of John Lord Erskine,
Patrick Lord Ruthven, and of Secretary Maitland
of Lethington. The bride's dowry consisted of
&pound;500 a year in land, the gift of the Queen, to which
Lord Livingston added 100 merks a year in land, or
1000 merks in money. As a jointure she received
the Barony of Beltreis near Castle Semple, in Renfrewshire,
the lands of Auchimanes and Calderhaugh,
with the rights of fisheries in the Calder, taxed to
the Crown at &pound;18, 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a year.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">A few days after the marriage, on the 9th of
March, a grant from the Queen to Mary Livingston
and John Sempill passed the great seal. In
this official document she styles the bride "her
familiar servatrice", and the bridegroom "her daily
and familiar serviter, during all the youthheid and
minority of the said serviters". In recognition of
their services both to herself and the Queen Regent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
she infeofs them in her town and lands of Auchtermuchty,
part of her royal demesne in Fifeshire, the
lands and lordships of Stewarton in Ayr, and the
isle of Little Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde.</p>

<p class="indent">After her marriage "Madamoiselle de Semple"
was appointed lady of the bedchamber, an office for
which she received &pound;200 a year. Her husband also
seems to have retained some office which required
his personal attendance on the Queen, for we know
that both husband and wife were in waiting at Holyrood
on the memorable evening of David Rizzio's
murder. The shock which this tragic event produced
on Mary was very great, and filled her with
the darkest forebodings. She more than once expressed
her fear that she would not survive her
approaching confinement. About the end of May
or the beginning of June, shortly before the solemn
ceremony of "taking her chamber", she caused an
inventory of her personal effects to be drawn up by
Mary Livingston and Margaret Carwod, the bedchamber
woman in charge of her cabinet, and with
her own hand wrote, on the margin opposite to each
of the several articles, the name of the person for
whom it was intended, in the event of her death
and of that of her infant. Mary Livingston's name
appears by the side of the following objects in the
original document, which was discovered among
some unassorted law papers in the Register House,
in August, 1854:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Only on one occasion after this do we find mention
of Mary Livingston in connection with her royal
mistress. It is on the day following the Queen's
surrender at Carberry, when she was brought back
a prisoner to Edinburgh. The scene is described
by Du Croc, the French Ambassador. "On the
evening of the next day," he writes in the official
report forwarded to his court, "at eight o'clock, the
Queen was brought back to the castle of Holyrood,
escorted by three hundred arquebusiers, the Earl
of Morton on the one side, and the Earl of Athole
on the other; she was on foot, though two hacks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
were led in front of her; she was accompanied at
the time by Mademoiselle de Sempel and Seton,
with others of her chamber, and was dressed in a
night-gown of various colours."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">After the Queen's removal from Edinburgh the
Sempills also left it to reside sometimes at Beltreis,
and sometimes at Auchtermuchty, but chiefly in
Paisley, where they built a house which was still to
be seen but a few years ago, near what is now the
Cross. Their retirement from the capital did not,
however, secure for them the quietness which they
expected to enjoy. They had stood too high in
favour with the captive Queen to be overlooked by
her enemies. The Regent Lennox, remembering
that Mary Livingston had been entrusted with the
care of the royal jewels and wardrobe, accused her
of having some of the Queen's effects in her possession.
Notwithstanding her denial, her husband
was arrested and cast into prison, and she herself
brought before the Lords of the Privy Council.
Their cross-questioning and brow-beating failed to
elicit any information from her, and it was only
when Lennox threatened to "put her to the horn",
and to inflict the torture of the "boot" on her
husband, that she confessed to the possession of
"three lang-tailit gowns garnished with fur of martrix
and fur of sables". She protested, however,
that, as was indeed highly probable, these had been
given to her, and were but cast-off garments, of little
value or use to anyone. In spite of this, she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
not allowed to depart until she had given surety
"that she would compear in the council-chamber on
the morrow and surrender the gear".</p>

<p class="indent">Lennox's death, which occurred shortly after this,
did not put an end to the persecution to which
the Sempills were subjected. Morton was as little
friendly to them as his predecessor had been. He
soon gave proof of this by calling upon John Sempill
to leave his family and to proceed to England, as
one of the hostages demanded as security for the
return of the army and implements of war, sent,
under Sir William Drury, to lay siege to Edinburgh
Castle.</p>

<p class="indent">On his return home, Sempill found new and worse
troubles awaiting him. It happened that of the
lands conferred upon Mary Livingston on her marriage
some portion lay near one of Morton's estates.
Not only had the Queen's gift been made by a
special grant under the Great and Privy Seals, but
the charter of infeofment had also been ratified by
a further Act of Parliament in 1567, when it was
found that the proposal to annul the forfeiture of
George Earl of Huntly would affect it. It seemed
difficult, therefore, to find even a legal flaw that
would avail to deprive the Sempills of their lands
and afford the Regent an opportunity of appropriating
them to himself. He was probably too powerful,
however, to care greatly for the justice of his
plea. He brought the matter before the Court of
Session, urging that the gift made by the Queen
to Mary Livingston and her husband was null and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
void, on the ground that it was illegal to alienate
the lands of the Crown. It was in vain that Sempill
brought forward the deed of gift under the Great
and Privy Seals, the judges would not allow his
plea. Thereupon Sempill burst into a violent passion,
declaring that if he lost his suit, it would cost
him his life as well. Whiteford of Milntoune, a
near relative of Sempill's, who was with him at the
time, likewise allowed his temper to get the better
of his discretion, and exclaimed "that Nero was but
a dwarf compared to Morton". This remark, all
the more stinging that it was looked upon as a
sneer at the Regent's low stature, was never forgiven.
Not long after the conclusion of the lawsuit,
both Sempill and Whiteford were thrown into
prison on a charge "of having conspired against the
Regent's life, and of having laid in wait by the Kirk,
within the Kirkland of Paisley, to have shot him, in
the month of January, 1575, at the instigation of the
Lords Claud and John Hamilton". After having
been detained in prison till 1577, John Sempill was
brought up for trial on this capital charge. His
alleged crime being of such a nature that it was
probably found impossible to prove it by the testimony
of witnesses, he was put to the torture of the
boot, with which he had been threatened on a former
occasion. By this means sufficient was extorted from
him to give at least a semblance of justice to the
sentence of death which was passed on him. In
consideration of this confession, however, the sentence
was not carried out. Ultimately he was set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
at liberty and restored to his family. His health
had completely broken down under the terrible
ordeal through which he had gone, and he only
lingered on till the 25th of April, 1579.</p>

<p class="indent">Of Mary Livingston's life after the death of her
husband but little is known. From an Act of Parliament
passed in November, 1581, it appears that
tardy justice was done her by James VI, who caused
the grants formerly made to "umquhile John Semple,
of Butress, and his spouse, to be ratified". Her
eldest son, James, was brought up with James VI,
and in later life was sent as ambassador to England.
He was knighted in 1601. There were three other
children&mdash;two boys, Arthur and John, and one girl,
Dorothie.</p>

<p class="indent">The exact date of Mary Livingston's death is not
known, but she appears to have been living in 1592.</p>

<h2>MARY BETON</h2>

<p class="indent">The family to which Mary Beton, or, as she herself
signed her name, Marie Bethune, belonged, seems
to have been peculiarly devoted to the service of
the house of Stuart. Her father, Robert Beton, of
Creich, is mentioned amongst the noblemen and
gentlemen who sailed from Dumbarton with the
infant Queen, in 1548, and who accompanied her
in 1561, when she returned to take possession of
the Scottish throne. His office was that of one
of the Masters of the Household, and, as such, he
was in attendance at Holyrood when the murderers
of Rizzio burst into the Queen's chamber and
stabbed him before her eyes. He also appears
under the style of Keeper of the Royal Palace of
Falkland, and Steward of the Queen's Rents in
Fife. At his death, which occurred in 1567, he
recommends his wife and children to the care of the
Queen, "that scho be haill mantenare of my hous
as my houpe is in hir Maiestie under God". His
grandfather, the founder of the house, was comptroller
and treasurer to King James IV. His aunt
was one of the ladies of the court of King James V,
by whom she was the mother of the Countess of
Argyll. One of his sisters, the wife of Arthur
Forbes of Reres, stood high in favour with Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Mary, and was wet-nurse to James VI. His French
wife, Jehanne de la Runuelle, and two of his
daughters, were ladies of honour.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the four Marys, Mary Beton has left least
trace in the history of the time. It seems to have
been her good fortune to be wholly unconnected
with the political events which, in one way or
another, dragged her fair colleagues into their vortex,
and it may be looked upon as a proof of the
happiness of her life, as compared with their eventful
careers, that she has but little history.</p>

<p class="indent">Though but few materials remain to enable us to
reconstruct the story of Mary Beton's life, a fortunate
chance gives us the means of judging of the
truth of the high-flown compliments paid to her
beauty by both Randolph and Buchanan. A portrait
of her is still shown at Balfour House, in Fife.
It represents, we are told, "a very fair beauty, with
dark eyes and yellow hair", and is said to justify
all that has been written in praise of her personal
charms.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
The first to fall a victim to these was the
English envoy, Randolph. A letter of his to the
Earl of Bedford, written in April, 1565, mentions,
as an important fact, that Mistress Beton and he
had lately played a game at biles against the Queen
and Darnley, that they had been successful against
their royal opponents, and that Darnley had paid
the stakes.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
In another letter, written to Leicester,
he thinks it worthy of special record that for four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
days he had sat next her at the Queen's table, at
St. Andrews. "I was willed to be at my ordinary
table, and being placed the next person, saving
worthy Beton, to the Queen herself." Writing to
the same nobleman he makes a comparison between
her and Mary Fleming, of whom, as we have seen,
he had drawn so glowing a description, and declares
that, "if Beton had lyked so short a time, so worthie
a rowme, Flemyng to her by good right should have
given place".<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
Knowing, as we do, from the testimony
of other letters, how prone Randolph was to
overrate his personal influence, and with what amusing
self-conceit he claimed for himself the special
favours of the ladies of the Scottish Court, there is
every reason to suspect the veracity of the statement
contained in the following extract from a letter to
Sir Henry Sidney: "I doubt myself whether I be
the self-same man that now will be content with
the name of your countryman, that have the whole
guiding, the giving, and bestowing, not only of the
Queen, and her kingdom, but of the most worthy
Beton, to be ordered and ruled at mine own will".</p>

<p class="indent">Like her colleague, Mary Fleming, "the most
worthy Beton" had her hour of mock royalty, as
we learn from three sets of verses in which Buchanan
extols her beauty, worth, and accomplishments, and
which are inscribed: "Ad Mariam Betonam pridie
Regalium Reginam sorte ductam". In the first of
these, which bears some resemblance to that addressed
to Mary Fleming on a similar occasion, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
asserts, with poetical enthusiasm, the mimic sovereign's
real claims to the high dignity which Fortune
has tardily conferred upon her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Princely in mind and virtue, and so fair,</span>
<span class="i0">You've long seemed fit a diadem to wear;</span>
<span class="i0">And Fortune, blushing to have stood aloof,</span>
<span class="i0">Now lavishes her gifts to your behoof;</span>
<span class="i0">Deeming atonement for her tardiness</span>
<span class="i0">Demands in justice she should do no less,</span>
<span class="i0">She brings the Queen whom all the rest obey</span>
<span class="i0">A willing subject to your sovereign sway.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">In his next effusion the poet rises to a more passionate
height in his admiration. It is such as we
might imagine Randolph to have penned in his
enthusiasm, could we, by any flight of fancy, suppose
him capable of such scholarly verses as those
of Buchanan:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Should I rejoice, or should my heart despair,</span>
<span class="i0">That Beton's yoke the Fates have made me bear?</span>
<span class="i0">O, Comeliness, what need have I of thee,</span>
<span class="i0">When hope of mutual love is dead for me?</span>
<span class="i0">For favours such as these, in life's young day,</span>
<span class="i0">E'en life had seemed no heavy price to pay;</span>
<span class="i0">And though my earthly bliss had been but brief,</span>
<span class="i0">Its fulness would have soothed my dying grief;</span>
<span class="i0">Now, ling'ring fires consume; I lack life's joy,</span>
<span class="i0">And death would bring me comfort, not annoy;</span>
<span class="i0">In life, in death, be this my comfort still,</span>
<span class="i0">That life and death are at my Lady's will.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
The third epigram is more particularly interesting,
as bearing reference, we think, to Mary Beton's
literary tastes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beneath cold Winter's blast the fields are bare,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor yield a posy for my Lady fair;</span>
<span class="i0">E'en so my Muse, luxuriant in her prime,</span>
<span class="i0">Has felt the chill and numbing grip of time;</span>
<span class="i0">Could lovely Beton's spirit but inspire,</span>
<span class="i0">'Twere Spring again, with all its life and fire.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The will drawn up by Mary Stuart, in 1556,
which, it is true, never took effect, seems to point
to Mary Beton as the most scholarly amongst the
maids of honour. It is to her that the French,
English, and Italian books in the royal collection
are bequeathed; the classical authors being reserved
for the University of St. Andrews, where they were
intended to form the nucleus of a library: "Je
laysse mes liuures qui y sont en Grec ou Latin &agrave;
l'universit&eacute; de Sintandre, pour y commencer une
bible. Les aultres ie les laysse &agrave; Beton."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">This is further borne out by the fact that,
many years later, William Fowler, secretary to
Queen Anne of Denmark, wife of James VI, dedicated
his "Lamentatioun of the desolat Olympia,
furth of the tenth cantt of Ariosto" "to the right
honourable ladye Marye Betoun, Ladye Boine". Of
the literary accomplishments which may fairly be
inferred from these circumstances, we have, however,
no further proof. Nothing of Mary Beton's
has come down to us, except a letter, addressed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
her in June, 1563, to the wife of Sir Nicholas
Throckmorton, whose acquaintance she may have
made either in France or in Scotland, Sir Nicholas
having been English Ambassador in both countries.
In this short document the writer acknowledges the
receipt of a ring, assures the giver that she will
endeavour to return her love by making her commendations
to the Queen, and begs her acceptance
in return, and as a token of their good love and
amity, of a little ring which she has been accustomed
to wear daily.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">In the month of May, 1566, Mary Beton married
Alexander Ogilvie, of Boyne. But little is known
of this marriage beyond the fact that the Queen
named the day, and beyond such circumstances of
a purely legal and technical nature as may be
gathered from the marriage contract, which is still
extant, and has been published in the Miscellany
of the Maitland Club. It sets forth that the bride
was to have a dowry from her father of 3000 merks,
and a jointure from her husband of lands yielding
150 merks and 30 chalders of grain yearly. This
legal document derives its chief interest from bringing
together in a friendly transaction persons who
played important and hostile parts in the most interesting
period of Scottish history. It bears the
signatures of the Queen and Henry Darnley, together
with those of the Earls of Huntly, Argyll,
Bothwell, Murray, and Atholl, as cautioners for the
bridegroom, that of Alexander Ogilvie himself, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
subscribes his territorial style of "Boyne" and that
of "Marie Bethune". The signature of the bride's
father, and that of Michael Balfour, of Burleigh, his
cautioner for payment of his daughter's tocher, are
wanting.</p>

<p class="indent">It would appear that Mary Beton, or, as she
was usually called after her marriage, "the Lady
Boyn", or "Madame de Boyn", did not immediately
retire from the Court. In what capacity,
however, she kept up her connection with it, cannot
be ascertained. All that we have been able to discover
is that after her marriage she received several
gifts of ornaments and robes from the Queen.
Amongst the latter we notice a dress which was
scarcely calculated to suit the fair beauty: "Une
robbe de satin jeaulne dore toute goffree faicte a
manches longues toute chamaree de bisette d'argent
bordee dung passement geaulne goffre d'argent!"<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Both Mary Beton and Alexander Ogilvie are said
to have been living as late as 1606. All that is
known as to the date of her death is that it occurred
before that of her husband, who, in his old age,
married the divorced wife of Bothwell, the Countess
Dowager of Sutherland.</p>

<p class="indent">It is interesting to note the contrast between the
comparatively uneventful reality of Mary Beton's
life and the romantic career assigned to her in one
of the best-known works of fiction that introduces
her in connection with her royal and ill-fated mistress.
In Mr. Swinburne's <cite>Mary Stuart</cite>, the catastrophe is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
brought about by Mary Beton. For some score
of years, from that day forth when she beheld the
execution of him on whom she is supposed to have
bestowed her unrequited love, of the chivalrous,
impetuous Chastelard, when her eyes "beheld fall
the most faithful head in all the world", Mary
Beton, "dumb as death", has been waiting for the
expiation, waiting</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Even with long suffering eagerness of heart</span>
<span class="i0">And a most hungry patience.</span>
</div></div>

<p>It is by her action in forwarding to Elizabeth the
letter in which Mary Stuart summed up all the
charges brought against her rival, that the royal
captive's doom is hastened, that Chastelard's death
is avenged. It would be the height of hypercritical
absurdity to find fault with the poet for the use
which he has made of a character which can scarcely
be called historical. Nevertheless, as it is often from
fiction alone that we gather our knowledge of the
minor characters of history&mdash;of those upon which
more serious records, engrossed with the jealousies
of crowned heads, with the intrigues of diplomatists
and the wrangles of theologians, have no attention
to bestow&mdash;it does not seem altogether useless at
least to point out how little resemblance there is
between the Mary Beton of real life and the Nemesis
of the drama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<h2>MARY SETON</h2>

<p class="indent">"The secund wyf of the said Lord George (Marie
Pieris, ane Frenche woman, quha come in Scotland
with Quene Marie, dochter to the Duik of Gweis)
bair to him tua sonnis and ane dochter ... the
dochter Marie." This extract from Sir Richard
Maitland's <cite>History of the House of Seton</cite> gives us
the parentage of the fourth of the Maries.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
She was the daughter of a house in which loyalty and
devotion to the Stuarts was traditional. In the
darkest pages of their history the name of the
Setons is always found amongst those of the few
faithful friends whom danger could not frighten
nor promises tempt from their allegiance. In this
respect Mary Seton's French mother was worthy
of the family into which she was received. At the
death of Marie de Guise, Dame Pieris transferred
not only her services, but her love also, to the
infant Queen, and stood by her with blind devotion
under some of the most trying circumstances of her
short career as reigning sovereign. The deposition
of French Paris gives us a glimpse of her, attending
on Mary and conferring secretly with Bothwell on
the morning after the King's murder. At a later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
date we find her conspiring with the Queen's friends
at what was known as the council "of the witches
of Atholl", and subsequently imprisoned, with her
son, for having too freely expressed her loyalty to
her mistress.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
We may, therefore, almost look upon
it as the natural result of Mary Seton's training,
and of her family associations, that she is pre-eminently
the Queen's companion in adversity.
It seems characteristic of this that no individual
mention occurs of her as bearing any part in the
festivities of the Court, or sharing her mistress's
amusements. Her first appearance coincides with
the last appearance of Mary Livingston in connection
with Mary Stuart. When the Queen, after
her surrender at Carberry, was ignominiously dragged
in her nightdress through the streets of her capital,
her faltering steps were supported by Mary Livingston
and Mary Seton. At Lochleven, Mary Seton,
still in attendance on her mistress, bore an important
part in her memorable flight, a part more dangerous,
perhaps, than Jane Kennedy's traditional leap from
the window, for it consisted in personating the Queen
within the castle, whilst the flight was taking place,
and left her at the mercy of the disappointed jailers
when faithful Willie Douglas had brought it to a
successful issue.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
How she fared at this critical moment, or how she herself contrived to regain
her liberty, is not recorded; but it is certain that
before long she had resumed her honourable but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
perilous place by the side of her royal mistress. It
is scarcely open to doubt that the one maid of
honour who stood with the Queen on the eminence
whence she beheld the fatal battle of Langside was
the faithful Mary Seton.</p>

<p class="indent">Although, so far as we have been able to ascertain,
Mary Seton's name does not occur amongst
those of the faithful few who fled with the Queen
from the field of Langside to Sanquhar and Dundrennan,
and although the latter actually states in
the letter which she wrote to the Cardinal de Lorraine,
on the 21st of June, that for three nights after
the battle she had fled across country, without being
accompanied by any female attendant, we need have
no hesitation in stating that Mary Seton must have
been amongst the eighteen who, when the infatuated
Mary resolved on trusting herself to the protection
of Elizabeth, embarked with her in a fishing smack
at Dundrennan, and landed at Workington. A letter
written by Sir Francis Knollys to Cecil, on the 28th
of June, makes particular mention of Mary Seton
as one of the waiting-women in attendance on the
Queen, adding further particulars which clearly point
to the fact that she had been so for at least several days:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">
Now here are six waiting-women, although none of reputation,
but Mistress Mary Seton, who is praised by this
Queen to be the finest busker, that is to say, the finest
dresser of a woman's head of hair, that is to be seen in any
country whereof we have seen divers experiences, since her
coming hither. And, among other pretty devices, yesterday
and this day, she did set such a curled hair upon the Queen,
that was said to be a perewyke, that showed very delicately.
And every other day she hath a new device of head-dressing,
without any cost, and yet setteth forth a woman gaylie
well.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">For the next nine years Mary Seton disappears
almost entirely in the monotony of her self-imposed
exile and captivity. A casual reference to her, from
time to time, in the Queen's correspondence, is the
only sign we have of her existence. Thus, in a letter
written from Chatsworth, in 1570, to the Archbishop
of Glasgow, to inform him of the death of his brother,
John Beton, laird of Creich, and to request him to
send over Andrew Beton to act as Master of the
Household, Mary Stuart incidentally mentions her
maid of honour in terms which, however, convey but
little information concerning her, beyond that of her
continued devotion to her mistress and her affection
for her mistress's friends. "Vous avez une amye
en Seton," so the Queen writes, "qui sera aussi satisfayte,
en votre absence, de vous servir de bonne
amye que parente ou aultre que puissiez avoir aupres
de moy, pour l'affection qu'elle porte &agrave; tous ceulx
qu'elle connait m'avoyr est&eacute; fid&eacute;les serviteurs."</p>

<p class="indent">The royal prisoner's correspondence for the year
1574 gives us another glimpse of her faithful attendant,
"qui tous les jours me fayct service tres
agreable," and for whom the Archbishop is requested
to send over from Paris a watch and alarum. "La
monstre que je demande est pour Seton. Si n'en
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
pouvez trouver une faite, faites la faire, simple et
juste, suyvant mon premier m&eacute;moyre, avec le reveil-matin
&agrave; part."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Three years must again elapse before Mary Seton's
next appearance. On this occasion, however, in 1577,
she assumes special importance, and figures as the
chief character in a romantic little drama which Mary
Stuart herself has sketched for us in two letters
written from her prison in Sheffield to Archbishop
Beton.</p>

<p class="indent">It will be remembered that when, in 1570, death
deprived Queen Mary of the services of John Beton,
her Master of the Household, she requested that his
younger brother should be sent over from Paris to
supply his place. In due time Andrew Beton appeared
at Sheffield and entered upon his honourable
but profitless duties. He was necessarily brought
into daily contact with Mary Seton, for whom he
soon formed a strong affection, and whom he sought
in marriage. The maid of honour, a daughter of the
proud house of Winton, does not appear to have felt
flattered by the attentions of Beton, who, though,
"de fort bonne maison", according to Brant&ocirc;me,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
was but the younger son of a younger son. Despairing
of success on his own merits, Andrew Beton at last
wrote to his brother, the Archbishop, requesting him
to engage their royal mistress's influence in furtherance
of his suit. The Queen, with whom, as we
know, match-making was an amiable weakness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
accepted the part offered her, and the result of her
negotiations is best explained by her own letter to
the Archbishop:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
According to the promise conveyed to you in my last
letter, I have, on three several occasions, spoken to my
maid. After raising several objections based on the respect
due to the honour of her house&mdash;according to the custom
of my country&mdash;but more particularly on the vow which
she alleges, and which she maintains, can neither licitly
nor honourably be broken, she has at last yielded to my
remonstrances and earnest persuasions, and dutifully submitted
to my commands, as being those of a good mistress
and of one who stands to her in the place of a mother,
trusting that I shall have due consideration both for her
reputation and for the confidence which she has placed in
me. Therefore, being anxious to gratify you in so good an
object, I have taken it upon myself to obtain for her a dispensation
from her alleged vow, which I hold to be null.
If the opinion of theologians should prove to coincide with
mine in this matter, it shall be my care to see to the rest.
In doing so, however, I shall change characters, for, as she
has confidently placed herself in my hands, I shall have to
represent not your interests, but hers. Now, as regards the
first point, our man, whom I called into our presence, volunteered
a little rashly, considering the difficulties which will
arise, to undertake the journey himself, to bring back the
dispensation, after having consulted with you as to the
proper steps to be taken, and to be with us again within
three months, bringing you with him. I shall request a
passport for him; do you, on your part, use your best
endeavours for him; they will be needed, considering the
circumstances under which I am placed. Furthermore, it
will be necessary to write to the damsel's brother, to
know how far he thinks I may go without appearing to
give too little weight to the difference of degree and

After having penned this interesting and well-meaning
epistle, the Queen communicated it to
Mary Seton, to whom, however, it did not appear
a fair statement of the case, and for whose satisfaction
a postscript was added:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
I have shown the above to the maiden, and she accuses
me of over-partiality in this, that for shortness' sake, I have
omitted some of the circumstances of her dutiful submission
to me, in making which she still entertained a hope that
some regard should be had for her vow, even though it
prove to be null, and that her inclination should also be
consulted, which has long been, and more especially since
our captivity, rather in favour of remaining in her present
state than of entering that of marriage. I have promised
her to set this before you, and to give it, myself, that
consideration which is due to her confidence in me. Furthermore,
I have assured her that, should I be led to persuade
her to enter into that state which is least agreeable to her,
it would only be because my conscience told me that it was
the better for her, and that there was no danger of the least
blame being attached to her. She makes a great point of
the disparity of rank and titles, and mentions in support
of this that she heard fault found with the marriage of the
sisters Livingston, merely for having wedded the younger
sons of their peers, and she fears that, in a country where
such formalities are observed, her own friends may have a
similar opinion of her. But, as the Queen of both of them,
I have undertaken to assume the whole responsibility, and
to do all that my present circumstances will allow, to make
matters smooth. You need, therefore, take no further
trouble about this, beyond getting her brother to let us
know his candid opinion.</p>

With his mistress's good wishes, and with innumerable
commissions from her ladies, Andrew
Beton set out on his mission. Whether the dispensation
was less easy to obtain than he at first
fancied, or whether other circumstances, perhaps of
a political nature, arose to delay him, twice the three
months within which he had undertaken to return
to Sheffield had elapsed before information of his
homeward journey was received. He had been successful
in obtaining a theological opinion favourable to
his suit, but it appeared that Mary Seton's objections
to matrimony were not to be removed with her vow.
This seems to be the meaning of a letter written to
Beton by Mary Stuart, in which, after telling him
that she will postpone the discussion of his affairs
till his return, she pointedly adds that Mary Seton's
letters to him must have sufficiently informed him
as to her decision, and that she herself, though willing
to help him by showing her hearty approval of
the match, could give no actual commands in the
matter. A similar letter to the Archbishop seems to
point to a belief on Mary's part that, in spite of the
dispensation, the match would never be concluded,
and that Beton would meet with a bitter disappointment
on his return to Sheffield. It was destined,
however, that he should never again behold either
his royal lady or her for whom he had undertaken
the journey. He died on his way homewards; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
we have no knowledge where or under what circumstances.
The first intimation of the event is contained,
as are, indeed, most of the details belonging
to this period, in the Queen's correspondence. In
a letter bearing the date of the 5th of November she
expresses to the Archbishop her regret at the failure
of her project to unite the Betons and the Setons, as
well as at the personal loss she had sustained by the
death of a faithful subject and servant.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">With this episode our knowledge of Mary Seton's
history is nearly exhausted. There is no further
reference to her in the correspondence of the next
six years, during which she continued to share her
Queen's captivity. About the year 1583, when her
own health had broken down under the hardships
to which she was subjected in the various prisons to
which she followed Mary Stuart, she begged and
obtained permission to retire to France. The remainder
of her life was spent in the seclusion of
the abbey of St. Peter's, at Rheims, over which
Ren&eacute;e de Lorraine, the Queen's maternal aunt,
presided.</p>

<p class="indent">The last memorial which we have of Mary Seton
is a touching proof of the affection which she still
bore her hapless Queen, and of the interest with
which, from her convent cell, she still followed the
course of events. It is a letter, written in October,
1586, to Courcelles, the new French Ambassador at
Holyrood; it refers to her long absence from Scotland,
and concludes with an expression of regret at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the fresh troubles which had befallen the captive
Queen.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
I cannot conclude without telling you the extreme pain
and anxiety I feel at the distressing news which has been
reported here, that some new trouble has befallen the Queen,

<h2>THE SONG OF MARY STUART</h2>
<h3>An Undetected Forgery</h3>

<p class="indent">Those who are acquainted with Brant&ocirc;me's delightful
collection of biographical sketches of Illustrious
Ladies, will remember that one of the most noteworthy
of them is devoted to Marie Stuart. In it,
amongst many other interesting details, he states
that the Queen used to compose verses, and that
he had seen some "that were fine and well done,
and in no wise similar to those which have been laid
to her account, on the subject of her love for the
Earl of Bothwell, and which are too coarse and ill-polished
to have been of her making". In another
passage he says that Mary "made a song herself
upon her sorrows"; and he quotes it.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
For close on two centuries and a half the "<cite>Chanson de Marie
Stuart</cite>", as given by him, has been reproduced in
biographies of the Queen of Scots, and has found
its way into numberless albums and anthologies.
That it should have been accepted without hesitation
on Brant&ocirc;me's authority is hardly surprising.
Of those who have written from personal acquaintance
with Mary, few were in a better position than
was the French chronicler to know the truth about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
her. He remembered her from her very childhood.
He was familiar with all the circumstances of her
training and education at Saint-Germain. He had
witnessed the precocious development of the talents
which excited the admiration of the courtiers that
gathered about Henry II and Catharine de' Medici.
He did not lose sight of her when, at a later date,
her marriage with the heir to the crown of France
gave her a household of her own in the stately
residence of Villers-C&ocirc;terets. He witnessed the
enthusiasm which greeted her as Queen-Consort,
as well as the deep and universal sympathy which
her early bereavement called forth; and when the
"White Queen", the dowager of seventeen, left the
country of her affection to undertake the heavy task
of governing her northern kingdom, he was amongst
those who accompanied her on her fateful journey.
In the circumstances, it did not occur, even to those
who, knowing Brant&ocirc;me's character, might feel that
much allowance was to be made for the conventional
enthusiasm of the courtier, to suspect that any of
his statements concerning Mary Stuart was to be
rejected as wholly devoid of foundation. And yet,
we are in a position to prove that, in one instance,
he asserted what he knew to be false; and we shall
follow that up by producing the strongest evidence
in support of the further charge that he was guilty
of a literary forgery.</p>

<p class="indent">In his sketch of Mary Stuart, Brant&ocirc;me does not
place her "Song" where it would most naturally be
looked for, that is, immediately after the passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
in which he refers to her poetical talent. He introduces
it clumsily, and in a way which, though
perhaps not sufficient of itself to justify suspicion,
is, at least, calculated to strengthen it when once it
has been aroused. He begins by giving a description
of the Queen, as she appeared in her white
widow's weeds. "It was", he says, "a beautiful sight
to see her, for the whiteness of her face vied for
pre-eminence with the whiteness of her veil. But,
in the end, it was the artificial whiteness of her veil
that had to yield, and the snow of her fair complexion
effaced the other. And so there was written
at Court a song about her in her mourning garments.
It was thus:" and here the anonymous
poem is quoted. It consists of two stanzas, each
containing six short lines. They depict the Goddess
of Beauty, attired in white, wandering about, with
the shaft of her inhuman son in her hand, whilst
Cupid himself is fluttering over her, with the bandage,
which he has removed from his eyes, doing
duty as a funereal veil on which are inscribed the
words: "Mourir ou estre pris". These verses, in
which it is difficult to discover any special application
to the widowed Queen, are followed, though
not immediately, by a reference to her bereavement:
"Hers was a happiness of short duration, and one
which evil fortune might well have respected on this
occasion; but, spiteful as she is, she would not be
deterred from thus cruelly treating the Princess, who
herself composed the following song on her loss and
affliction". The poem thus attributed to Mary is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
then brought in. It consists of the eleven well-known
stanzas, and begins with the line "En mon
triste et doux chant"&mdash;"In my sad and sweet
strains". Nobody ever thought of questioning its
genuineness. The obviously fragmentary nature of
the first poem, and the similarity of rhythm and
metre in both did not suggest the possibility of a
connection between them. Nor did it appear to be
incongruous and in bad taste that, if the Queen
undertook to write her own elegy, she should begin
by praising its sweetness. A comparatively recent
discovery, however, has placed it beyond doubt that
Brant&ocirc;me wittingly foisted on his readers verses
which he very well knew had not been written by
Mary Stuart.</p>

<p class="indent">Some years ago, whilst hunting through the dusty
shelves of an old bookshop at P&eacute;rigueux, Dr. E. Galy
chanced upon a manuscript collection of poems of
the sixteenth century. The gilt-edged and leather-bound
folio was found to consist of two distinct
parts. The first contained, together with a few
anonymous poems, extracts from the works of
Cl&eacute;ment Marot, Pierre de Ronsard, and other
writers of the period. The second, and, from the
literary point of view, more interesting section was
made up of a number of poems, chiefly sonnets,
composed by Brant&ocirc;me, and bearing the general
title: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil d'aulcunes rymes de mes Jeunes Amours
que j'ay d'aultres fois compos&eacute;es telles quelles</i>, that is,
"Collection of Certain Rhymes of my early loves,
which I formerly composed, such as they are".
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
This portion of the manuscript was published for
private circulation, by the fortunate finder, to whose
kindness we were indebted for a copy of the first
edition of the hitherto unsuspected poetical works
of Pierre de Bourdeille, Lord Abbot of Brant&ocirc;me,
Baron of Richemont.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">In the first division of the collection a very interesting
discovery was made. It was found to contain
both the anonymous "Song" composed "at Court",
in honour of Mary Stuart, and the "Song" attributed
to the Queen herself. The two poems, it
was now seen, were not originally distinct, the
anonymous verses being merely an introduction to
the longer "Song", and joined to it by three
stanzas, which are neither quoted nor alluded to
in Brant&ocirc;me's sketch of Mary. In its new form,
and as it was published in a very limited edition
of one hundred copies by Dr. Galy, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chanson
pour la Royne d'Ecosse portant le dueil</i>,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
is by no means a masterpiece. It has, however, the merit of
composing an harmonious whole. The "Complaint"
is preceded by an introduction which, both as regards
its length and the train of thought running through
it, is not out of keeping with the subject. It is
followed by a concluding stanza, which, though not
absolutely necessary, gives fullness and completeness
to the picture called up by the elegy. One advantage
which the new version of the longer song possesses
over the old is the modification of the first jarring
line. "En mon triste et doux chant," becomes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
"J'oy son triste et doux chant," that is, "I hear
her sad and sweet strains". This reading adapts
itself to the context, and connects the descriptive
stanzas with those of the lament in a simple and
natural manner.</p>

<p class="indent">As Dr. Galy pointed out, the new version of the
"Song", to which, it should be stated, no author's
name is attached, established, on the authority of
Brant&ocirc;me himself, that he had attributed to Mary
Stuart verses which he knew were not hers. It did
not, however, afford any clue to the real authorship,
and the possibility that the whole poem was of
Brant&ocirc;me's own composition does not seem to have
occurred to Dr. Galy. That such is the case is our
firm belief. A careful comparison of the anonymous
"Chanson" with the various poems avowedly by
Brant&ocirc;me has revealed such similarity, not only of
thought and imagery, but even of expression, as convinces
us that nobody but himself can be the author
of <cite>The Song of Mary Stuart</cite>.</p>

<p class="indent">The 102nd sonnet in Brant&ocirc;me's collection is one
which he addressed to Mlle de Limeuil. Not only
is the whole tone of it strikingly similar to that of
the "Song", but it contains passages which cannot
be explained away on the assumption of mere chance
resemblance. Thus, in the thirteenth stanza of the
"Song", Mary is represented as seeing her husband
if she happens to look into the water: "Soudain
le voy en l'eau". In the sonnet, Brant&ocirc;me says;
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soudain</i> il m'advise qu'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en l'eau je voy</i> Limeuil".
In the first part of the same stanza, the mourning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Queen is supposed to behold in the clouds the
features of her lost husband. The same idea, expressed
in similar language, and with precisely the
same rhymes, occurs in some stanzas which Brant&ocirc;me
addressed to a lady "Sur un ennuy qui luy
survint". The main idea of the "Song"&mdash;that of
the sorrowing lady followed by the image of her
lost love, wherever she may wander&mdash;recurs repeatedly
in the sonnets, of which, indeed, several
may, without exaggeration, be described as mere
expansions of some of the lines in the "Song".
Altogether, we have noted distinct parallelisms to
five of the stanzas in the alleged "Chanson".
When it is remembered that, as Brant&ocirc;me gives
it, it consists of no more than eleven stanzas, the
proportion must appear striking. In addition to
this, it must also be noted that, in the eleven
stanzas of the lament itself, there are a number of
variants&mdash;we have counted nine altogether&mdash;which,
not being attributable to inaccurate copying, or necessary
for mere adaptation, testify to a deliberate revision,
hardly likely to have been the work of anyone
but the original author. In the face of such
evidence it seems to us that no alternative is left,
and that we must place Brant&ocirc;me on the same level
as Meunier de Querlon, who published the once
popular song, "Adieu, plaisant pays de France," and
attributed it to Mary Stuart, though he was himself
the author of it. Indeed, of the two, Brant&ocirc;me is
the less excusable; for, in his case, it cannot be
pleaded as an extenuating circumstance, as it can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in that of de Querlon, that he subsequently acknowledged
his "mystification". In any case, there
seems to be no reasonable doubt that we must
diminish by one the number of poems hitherto
believed to have been written by Mary Stuart.</p>

<p class="indent">Though the "Song" can no longer claim the
authorship of Mary Stuart, it still retains some
interest by reason of its strange story. To the best
of our knowledge, the original and complete poem,
of which, as we have stated, only 100 copies were
published in France, for private circulation, has
never been reproduced in this country. We therefore
append it.</p>

<h2>MAISTER RANDOLPHE'S FANTASIE</h2>
<h3>A Suppressed Satire</h3>

<p class="indent">About the middle of May, 1566, Robert Melvill
was dispatched by Mary, Queen of Scots, as a special
envoy to the English Court. The ostensible purpose
of his mission was to request Queen Elizabeth
to stand godmother to the royal infant whose birth
was shortly expected.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
And it was, indeed, with this object that his journey had, in the first instance,
been resolved upon. But, three or four days before
the time originally fixed for his departure,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
he had been hastily summoned to Holyrood and ordered
to set out at once, and with all speed, on an errand
of a very different kind. According to the tenor
of his later instructions, he was the bearer not of
a friendly message from Mary Stuart to her loving
cousin, but of a bitter complaint from the Queen
of Scotland to the English sovereign. Mary had
been informed by one of her agents at Berwick that
"there was a booke wrytten agaynst her, of her lyf
and govermente".<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Though possessing no actual knowledge of the contents of the obnoxious libel
and acquainted with its general tone and purport
only, she had "taken it so grevouslye as nothy&macr;ge
of longe time had come so near her hearte".<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
Not only did she resent the insult as a sovereign, but
she also felt the outrage as a woman, and expressed
her fear lest, having come to her so suddenly and
at so critical a time, the unwelcome intelligence
"sholde breed daynger to her byrthe or hurte to
her selfe".<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
And Melvill had been hurried off to
London to inform Elizabeth of the crime committed
by one of her subjects, "that in tyme this worke
mighte be suppressed and",<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
more important still, "condign punishment taken upon the wryter"; for
by this means alone, the indignant Queen declared,
could it be made apparent that he was not "mayntayned
against her, not only by advise and counsell
to move her subiects agaynste her, but also by defamations
and falce reports mayke her odious to the
werlde".<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The work at which such grievous offence had
been taken was entitled <cite>Maister Randolphe's Fantasie</cite>,
and the informant who had given Mary notice of
its publication had also assured her that it was in
reality what it purported to be, the production of
the agent who, till within a short time previously,
had represented England at the Scottish Court. She
accepted the charge without question and without
doubt. In her mind Thomas Randolph was associated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
with all the intrigues which had culminated
in the open defection and organized opposition of
the most powerful of her nobles, and she felt conscious
of having treated him with a harshness calculated
to add an ardent desire for revenge to the
malevolent intentions by which she believed him
to be actuated. During the last six months of his
residence in Edinburgh he had been subjected to
a series of petty vexations, of personal attacks and
of open accusations, which even his avowed partisanship
could not justify, and which were not less discreditable
to the instigators of them than insulting
to the sovereign whom he represented. On the
formation of the league to which Mary's marriage
with Darnley had given rise he had been threatened
with punishment "for practising with the Queen's
rebels".<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
Mary herself had shown her displeasure
in so marked a manner that Randolph had sent to
England a formal complaint of the difficulties thrown
into his way by her refusal to give him access to her
presence, even on official business.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
When at last she did grant him an audience, it was not for purposes
of political negotiation, but solely to upbraid
him "for his many evil offices" towards her.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
The dread of immediate imprisonment,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
and the personal violence to which he was actually subjected,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
had rendered his position so intolerable that he petitioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
for permission to retire to Berwick.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
His request was denied him; but the consequences of
the refusal soon showed how ill-advised had been
the action of those who had insisted upon his continuance
in functions for which he now lacked the
essential conditions of favour and security. In the
beginning of the following year he was summoned
before the Queen in Council, and publicly accused
of abetting the Earl of Murray in his treasonable
designs, and supplying him with funds to carry
them out.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
In spite of his direct and explicit denial
of a charge which was in reality without foundation,
he was ignominiously ordered to leave the country.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
Anxious as he had been to be relieved from duties
which had become as dangerous as they were difficult,
Randolph nevertheless refused to obey. He
appealed from Mary and her Lords to Elizabeth,
to the sovereign to whom he owed his allegiance,
and was answerable for his conduct, by whose favour
he had been appointed to a position of confidence
and honour, and at whose command alone he would
consent to surrender his trust. On hearing the
slight which had been put upon her accredited representative,
the Queen of England took up his
cause with characteristic promptitude and energy.
She at once dispatched a letter to the Queen of
Scots complaining "of her strange and uncourteous
treatment of Mr. Randolph",<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and informing her that his departure from Edinburgh would be the
signal for the dismissal of the Scottish agent from
the English Court. In spite of Elizabeth's remonstrances,
and in the face of a threat which was so
far from being idly meant that it was peremptorily
carried out less than a fortnight later,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Randolph's expulsion was insisted upon. After having twice
again received orders from the Lords,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
he at length yielded to necessity and retired across the Border to
Berwick.</p>

<p class="indent">That Randolph, smarting under such treatment,
should have made use of his enforced leisure and
of the knowledge which he had had special opportunities
for acquiring to write a book by which he
hoped to injure her cause and tarnish her reputation,
doubtless seemed to Mary to be so natural
that she deemed it unnecessary to institute further
enquiries into the truth of the charge brought
against him. His guilt was assumed as soon as
the accusation was made, and, by a singular coincidence,
if, indeed, it was not of set purpose, the same
Minister whose dismissal had followed his own disgrace
was sent back to Elizabeth to demand his
punishment.</p>

<p class="indent">Randolph's reply was not delayed. He was at
Berwick when Melvill passed through it on his way
to London, and learnt directly from his own lips all
the particulars of the alleged libel, of the Queen's
anger, and of her determination to bring down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
exemplary chastisement upon the offender's head. At
once availing himself of the advantage which this
early information afforded him, he drew up an emphatic
and indignant denial of the whole indictment
and a firm vindication of his conduct at the Scottish
Court. He wrote with a manly frankness and dignity
which are not always characteristic of his correspondence,
adding considerable weight to his
solemn protestations of innocence by the candid
avowal of the suspicion with which he viewed the
Queen's policy, and to which he had more than
once given expression in his official communications
to the home Government. "I coulde hardelye have
beleved,"<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
he said, "that anye suche reporte coulde
have come owte of this towne to that Q: or that
her g. wolde upon so slender information so suddaynlie
agayne gyve credit to anye such report, in
specaill that she wolde so hastelye w<sup>th</sup>owte farther

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
In the face of this unqualified disclaimer, it would
have required not merely suspicion founded on the
unsupported assertion of a nameless informer, but
the most direct and irrefutable evidence, to substantiate
the charge brought against Randolph. His
letter bore its own confirmation on the face of it.
It was not meant for the public, who might perhaps
have been put off by high-sounding phrases and
protestations; neither was it intended for the Scottish
Queen, who, though better informed, had no
special facilities for testing the statements which it
contained. It was addressed to Cecil, to the Minister
with whom Randolph had been in constant correspondence
for years, to whom he had communicated
the trifling events of each day&mdash;incidents of Court
life and scraps of Court gossip&mdash;who knew the extent
of his experience of Scottish affairs, and was as
familiar with his views as with his peculiarities of
style and diction in expressing them; to the last
man, in short, whom it would have been possible
to hoodwink as to the authorship of a work bearing
traces of either the hand or the inspiration of his
subordinate.</p>

<p class="indent">But, if Randolph had been the author of the poem
bearing his name, besides being deterred from any
attempt at deception by the almost certainty of
failure, he would doubtless have remembered that
Cecil was one of the bitterest enemies of the Queen
of Scots, and that, at the pitch which party animosity
had reached, even though, for the sake of appearances,
some indignation might be simulated, no
serious offence was likely to be taken at a work
tending to vilify the rival with whom, in spite of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the hollow show of friendship still maintained, an
open rupture was imminent, whose difficulties, far
from calling forth sympathy, were the subject of
thinly-veiled exultation, whose indiscretions were
distorted into faults, and whose errors were magnified
into crimes. Had he been concerned in the
production of the <cite>Fantasie</cite>, he possessed sufficient
shrewdness to know that his wisest and safest course
did not lie in a denial of which the falsehood could
not escape exposure, but in a confession which,
whilst attended with no real danger, might actually
tend to his credit.</p>

<p class="indent">Cecil accepted Randolph's disclaimer without demur,
and in a manner which left no doubt that he
was thoroughly convinced of its absolute truth. It
was deemed of sufficient importance to be answered
with no further delay than was rendered necessary
by the slow means of communication of the time.
To his letter of the 26th of May Randolph received
a reply as early as the 6th of the following month.
It has, unfortunately, not been preserved; but, though
it is impossible to reproduce the language in which
it was couched, it is easy to judge of its purport
and of the tone which pervaded it. These may be
gathered from the grateful acknowledgment which
it called forth from Randolph. "Yt may please
yo<sup>r</sup> H:," he wrote in a letter dated from Berwick
on the 7th of June, "that yesterdaye I receaved
yo<sup>r</sup> letter of the thyrde of this instant for w<sup>ch</sup> I do
most humblye thanke you and have therby receaved
maynie thyngs to my co&macr;tentation. In speciall for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the wrytinge of that fantasie or dreame called by
my name, that I am thought fawltles, as in deade
I am, but still greeved that I am so charged, but
that waye seeke no farther to please then with my
deutie maye stonde. Yf M<sup>r</sup> Melvill remayne so
well satysfied that he thinke me cleare, I truste that
he will performe no les then he promised, that the
reporter bycawse he is in this towne shalbe knowne,
at the leaste yf not to me, I wolde y<sup>r</sup> h: were warned
of such."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">A few days after the receipt by Randolph of
Cecil's letter, Elizabeth dispatched from Greenwich
an answer to the complaints of which Melvill had
been the bearer. It was a singular document in
which words were skilfully used to veil the writer's
meaning, and irony was disguised beneath the fairest
show of sympathy. While seeming to promise complete
satisfaction, it contained no expression but
might be explained away, and it carefully refrained
from putting forth any opinion with regard to Randolph's
guilt or innocence. It began by assuring
the Queen of Scots that she was not the only one
who had been moved to anger on hearing of <cite>Randolphe's
Fantasie</cite>, and by asserting, with feigned indignation,
that even to dream treason was held to be
a crime worthy of banishment from England, where
subjects were required to be loyal not in their words
merely, but in their very thoughts also; it bade her
rest satisfied that, for the investigation of the subject
complained of, such means should be used as would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
let the whole world know in what esteem her reputation
was held; and it concluded by hinting at no
less a punishment than death when the truth was
found out: "Mais quant je lisois la fascherye en
quoy vous estiez pour avoir ouy du songe de Randolphe"&mdash;so
ran the letter&mdash;"je vous prometz que
nestiez seule en cholere. Sy est ce que l'opinion
que les songes de la nuit sont les denonciations des
pens&eacute;es iournelles fussent verefyez en luy, s'il n'en
eust que song&eacute; et non point escript, je ne le penserois
digne de Logis en mon Royaulme. Car non
seulement veul je que mes subiectz ne disent mal
des princes, mais que moins est, de n'en penser sinon
honorablement. Et sois asseur&eacute;e que pense tellement
traicter ceste cause, que tout le monde verra
en quel estyme je tiens vr<sup>~</sup>e renom&macr;&eacute;e, et useray de
telz moyens pour en cognoistre la v&eacute;rit&eacute;, qu'il ne
tiendra a moy sy je ne la scache. Et la trouvant,
je la laisseray a vr<sup>~</sup>e jugement si la pugnition ne soyt
digne pour telle faulte, combien que je croy que la vye
d'aulcun n'en pourra bonnement equivaller la cryme."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Whatever may have been Mary's opinion as to
the true spirit of this reply, she saw that its language
left no ground for further remonstrance.
Perhaps, too, doubts may have entered her own
mind as to the authenticity of the obnoxious poem.
At any rate she seems to have thought it wise to
urge the matter no further. It dropped and died
away; no reference to it again occurs in the correspondence
of the period.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
It would be vain to search the literature of the
sixteenth century for any trace of <cite>Maister Randolphe's
Fantasie</cite>. No mention of it is to be found even
in the most minute and detailed of contemporary
chroniclers. In modern histories its very name is
unknown. No copy of it is preserved in our great
libraries, and if a stray one should have escaped the
summary suppression which the angry Queen demanded
of Elizabeth,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
it must be lying hidden amongst pamphlets and broadsides on the shelves
of some private collection. But, by some strange
chance, though the printed work has disappeared,
the manuscript has survived; and we are still able
to satisfy our curiosity with regard to the contents
of the obnoxious satire which gave such grave
offence to the Queen of Scots.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">In the manuscript copy preserved amongst the
documents of the Record Office,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
<cite>Maister Randolphe's Fantasie</cite>&mdash;the sub-title of which conveys
the information that it is "a breffe calgulacion of
the procedinge in Scotlande from the first of Julie
to the last of December"&mdash;is prefaced by an "Epistle
dedicatorie" addressed "to the right worshipfull M<sup>r</sup>
Thomas Randolphe esquyre Resident for the Quenes
Ma<sup>ties</sup> affaires in Scotlande". The author begins this
quaint, diffuse, and at times obscure production by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
setting forth the reasons which have led him to look
for "some ripe and grave patronage" for his "small
travell". He pleads the precedent of "eloquent
wryters", who, "albeit there excellent works learnedlie
compiled, needed no patronage, not onelie appeled
to others learned, but sought th'awctorytie of the
gravest men, to sheld them from th'arrogant curyous
and impewdent reprehendors". With much
rhetorical amplification he then proceeds to enumerate
the qualifications which seem more particularly
to designate Randolph as a fitting patron and protector.
"Well may I, knowing yo<sup>r</sup> zelous nature
and inclynacion to letters attempt to royst under the
protexion of yo<sup>r</sup> name. Who can better judge of
theis whole proceedings than you? Who can so
well wyttnes it as yo<sup>r</sup> dailie attendaunce? Who may
better defende it then yo<sup>r</sup> learned experience? Who
so well deserves the memorye hereof then yo<sup>r</sup> long
and wearye service, especiallie sithence the troblesome
broiles and monstrouous eschange in this transformed
and blundered comon-weale? Who may
so well auctoryshe the vnlearned aucto<sup>r</sup> as yo<sup>r</sup> w: to
whom justlie awaytinge yo<sup>r</sup> succor, simplie I retyre."
From this apostrophe he passes on to a justification
of his poem, in which he claims to have "delt
franklie" and, "as God shall bee his judge, not
pertiallie", and which he has produced solely in
compliance with the earnest and repeated solicitations
of influential friends. "I had not compiled this
tragidye, as iustlie I may terme it", he writes, "yf
some my contremen, resolved of muche better then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
I can or ought conceyve of my selffe, by there
sundrye letters and meanes entreated me to wryte
what I sawe, w<sup>ch</sup> chefflie by there procurement I have
doen, who, havinge care of my well doinge, perswaded
me howe profytable and necessarye it was
to vse my terme and travell, and imploy that talent
that might tend to my great comodytie and avale.
Theis indenyable requestes and ffrendlie reasons did
so charme me, albeit long deaffe at there enchantments,
that I cold not refuse to susteane this charge,
that nowe enforcethe my well meanynge to run post (I
knowe) to some vnwelcome gwides, that w<sup>th</sup> twyned
mynde will intercept my meanynge. Thus tranede
and, as it were, bewytched w<sup>th</sup> this vnweldye charge
of request, I pushe forthe this vnpolished phantasey,
a breffe calgulacion of theis procedinges." Though
confessedly anxious to reap any reward which his
poetical venture may be thought to deserve, the
author does not appear to be equally willing to
monopolize the "blame and infayme, yf any there
bee". On the contrary, he is careful to point out&mdash;"to
make his blames more excusable for there importunytie"&mdash;that
they who have urged him to write
are "accessaryes yf not principalls in his unwillinge
cryme", and that it would be a cruel hardship, indeed,
were he doomed "to thole ignomynye" and
"live a condempned byarde", for the sake of "cleringe
others". It is with the evident intention of
giving force to this plea that, whilst seeming to
prefer a humble request that Randolph "will not
refuse to surname" the offspring of his "restless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Mewse", he takes the opportunity of pointing him
out "as the cheffe parent thereof". With what
success this questionable device was attended Mary's
complaint to Elizabeth has already set forth.</p>

<p class="indent">After having fenced himself round, in his dedication,
with all these rhetorical safeguards, the author
turns to the reader with a poetical appeal to "arrest
his judgement", and then addresses himself to the
task of recording the "proceedings" of the eventful
six months which followed Mary's ill-advised marriage
with Darnley.</p>

<p class="indent">The first part of the <cite>Fantasie</cite> opens with a
poetical sketch, in which the author represents
himself as sunk in melancholy meditation, and endeavouring
to find relief from the heavy burthen
which the intrigues and disappointments of Court

</div></div>

<p class="indent">Whilst he is thus revolving "what fyttest were for
feble myndes", his conflicting thoughts, personified
as "Desire", "Tyme", "Fansye", and "Reason",
appear before him and volunteer, in turn, such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
advice as seems best suited to the situation. "Desire",
whose opinion is naturally the first to find
expression, suggests that he should seek "such rest
as may revive his pensive thought, with sorrow so
opprest". "Tyme", however, interposes with a
reminder that "feldishe sports be now exempt",
and that the season is not "mete" for the amusements
that might delight his spirits. This affords
"Fansye" an opportunity of making herself heard.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>But this advice does not meet with the approval of
"Reason". She points out to the poet that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Devyne Camenes never cold&emsp;with Mavors' rage agree,</span>

</div></div>

<p>and that, if he should allow himself to be hurried by
his sympathies into championing every cause and
"wrastling in eche wrong", the result must be as
useless as though "he shold stope the streame, or
sporne against the sone". Bidding him be ruled by
her, she counsels him to "mesure by myrthe some
meane that may his grieves disgest", to "solace the
rage of hevmayne cares within a gladsome brest",
and to follow the safer course of "sojourning with
silence", unless, indeed, he should be able to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
"a frend on whom he may repose the secretes of
his mynde". But "rareness of suche one" suggests
moral reflections on the dangers of flattery, with its
"sewgred speech", and on the fickleness of friendship,
"a flyinge birde with wings of often change".
These, and a further recommendation to prudent
silence, which, though it "do allay no rage of stormy
thoughte", is at least preferable to the "bankroote
gest" distrust, bring Reason's harangue to a close.</p>

<p class="indent">In a passage of some merit, but so singularly out
of place that it suggests an error of transcription, the
poet proceeds to describe the dreary season to which
Fancy has already made reference:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">It was when Awtum had&emsp;fild full the barnes with corne,</span>
<span class="i0">And he that eats and emtyes all&emsp;away had Awtum worne,</span>
<span class="i2">And wynter windes approcht&emsp;that doth ibayre the trene,</span>

<span class="i2">whose lustie hewe dispoiled&emsp;cold not possess the place,</span>
<span class="i0">ne yet abide Boreas' blasts&emsp;that althings dothe deface.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">After this digression Reason's advice is taken into
consideration. Recognizing its wisdom, the poet at
first "seeks by solitarye meanes to recreate his
minde". The attempt is not, however, crowned
with success. He experiences that, "as the sowthfast
sayen", "solytarynes" is but "hewe of dispaire,
ffoo to his weale, and frendlie to ech payne", and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that slender indeed "are the greves that silence do
unlade". In his solitude the evils of his own position
crowd up before him, he "beats his branes with
bitter bale and woos of worldlie force", he recalls the
"painful years" which he has "lingered forth" in
Scotland, with the sole reward of seeing "his credyt
crak the string with those with whome in faythfull
league he long before had bene", and himself "rolled
out of Fortune's lappe". By a natural transition he
passes from his own grievances to a consideration of
the political events which have produced them; his
"bewsye heade" calls up the "sowre change", the
"sodaine fall" of the realme "from weale to woo,
from welthe to wast, and worce if ought might be".</p>

<p class="indent">The cue for it being thus given, there follows a
recapitulation of the "proceedings" which are the
real subject of the <cite>Fantasie</cite>. "I saw", the poet says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="indent">Here the poet, who seems anxious to lose no
opportunity of pointing a moral, interrupts for a
while his sombre description of the state of Scotland
under this "reckles rule", to introduce his
own reflections upon "the slipper state of worldlie
wealth that heare on earth we finde". Resuming
his lamentation, he records the undeserved disgrace
of "those whose grave advice in judgement semed
vpright", and the unwise promotion to offices of
trust of those "which grated<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
but for gayne and gropt for private pray", who presumptuously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
attempted to "gwide a shipe against the storme",
though they "had not the skill in calm to stire a
barge".</p>

<p class="indent">Lest the application of the general statement should
remain doubtful, it is illustrated by reference to the
leading men of the Queen's party. To each of them
a couplet is dedicated, the symmetry being broken in
favour of Maxwell alone, who is thought worthy of
a double share of satire. Unfortunately, however,
the allusions are so vague and the language in many
cases so obscure, that it is difficult to catch more than
the drift of what is intended to characterize the conduct
and unveil the motives of each individual:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">The political correspondence and historical records
of the period allow us to remove, in some slight
degree, the obscurity which veils this passage, and
supply concerning the conduct of some of the characters
alluded to in it such particulars as may help
us to understand, if not the special point of the
poet's satire, at least the general reasons which
aroused his indignation and drew forth his censure.</p>

<p class="indent">It would have been difficult for the most bitter
opponent of the royal cause to find in Athole's conduct
during the period here referred to anything to
justify an attack on his personal character. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
is consequently no matter for astonishment in the
fact that the satirist&mdash;if our interpretation of the
couplet be the correct one&mdash;has no more heinous
offence to reproach him with than fidelity to his
trust and loyalty to his Queen. These, it is true,
he manifested on more than one critical occasion.
It was to Athole's house in Dunkeld that Mary,
knowing herself to be surrounded with spies in
Perth, determined to retire after the memorable
convention at which the intended marriage with
Darnley was made known. When, a few days
later, intelligence was brought by Lindsay of Dowhill
of a plot formed by the confederate Lords to
seize the Queen's person at Parenwell, to tear her
intended husband and his father from her side, and
to slay all who offered resistance to the deed of
violence, it was with Athole that Mary concerted
measures to frustrate the lawless attempt, and it
was by his exertions that a body of two hundred
gentlemen was raised to serve as an escort for her.
At the public solemnization of the Queen's marriage
it was Athole who, in recognition of his faithful
service, led both bride and bridegroom to the altar,
and who, at the banquet which followed, acted as
her carver. That these marks of favour were not
the only rewards bestowed upon his loyal attachment
is shown by Randolph in a letter which he
wrote to Cecil a few months later,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
and in which he states the Earl of Athole's influence to be paramount,
greater even than Bothwell's. If we be right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
in interpreting the charge of "abridging with craft to
conquer cost" to mean that Athole endeavoured to
husband the resources of the kingdom, it was a
course which the state of the Queen's finances more
than justified. The pecuniary difficulties in which
she was involved are repeatedly alluded to in Randolph's
despatches. On the 4th of July we find him
informing Cecil of the arrival of a chest supposed
to contain supplies of money, and significantly adding
that "if that way the Queen and Darnley have
either means or credit, it is so much the worse".<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
A fortnight later<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
he refers more plainly still to the
desperate condition of the royal exchequer, and states
that Mary "is so poor at present that ready money
she hath very little and credit none at all". In
August<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
he announces that "she hath borrowed
money of divers, and yet hath not wherewith to pay
so many soldiers as are levied for two months".
If, under these circumstances, Athole set himself the
arduous and thankless task of narrowly watching
over the expenditure of funds which it was so difficult
to raise, and even if the allusion contained in
the enigmatical accusation of "forging that fact by
forrayne foos" should point to any part taken by
him in obtaining "about fifteen hundred francs
which had been sent out of France", no impartial
judge can behold in this a proof of anything but
loyalty to his kinswoman and Queen.</p>

<p class="indent">The charge of "shufflinge for his share", the only
intelligible count in the indictment contained in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
couplet devoted to Morton, is fully justified by the
able but unscrupulous statesman's conduct during
the period of civil strife to which the <cite>Fantasie</cite>
refers. On the formation of the league for which
Mary's intentions towards her cousin had afforded
a pretence, Morton had joined the ranks of the confederate
Lords. Before long, however, his opposition
to the marriage was overcome and his services
secured for the royal cause by the sacrifice on the
part of Lennox and Darnley of their claims to the
honours and estates of Angus. Though his motives
were very far from being disinterested, his conduct
was for a while in strict conformity with the pledge
which had been bought from him, and he successfully
exerted his influence to conciliate some of the
bitterest opponents to the royal marriage. Such
as it was, however, his loyalty was but shortlived.
He took umbrage at the part assigned to Lennox
in the command of the army which marched out
to encounter the confederates. In the month of
October his treasonable designs were so far from
being a secret that Randolph described him as "only
making fair weather with the Queen till he could
espy his time".<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
But by her prompt and energetic action in compelling him to surrender the Castle of
Tantallon to the Earl of Athole,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
the Queen obliged him to declare himself sooner than he had intended,
and before his treachery could do any material injury
to her cause.</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Like his kinsman Morton, Ruthven, though
serving in the royal army, was in league with the
rebels. Between him and Mary there had never
existed any great sympathy, though, out of consideration
for Lennox, whose intimate associate he was,
she admitted him for a while to her favour and confidence.
As early as the beginning of July, however,
it was reported that "the Lord of Ruthven had
entered into suspicion",<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and three months later he
was also mentioned amongst those who were "only
making fair weather with the Queen".<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> His final
defection took place at the same time and for the
same cause as Morton's, the "plee" which he "preffered"&mdash;that
is, the claim which he also laid to a
part of the Angus estates, in right of Janet Douglas,
his wife&mdash;having been set aside by the royal order
which made over Tantallon to Athole.</p>

<p class="indent">The lines directed against Lennox and Darnley
require neither explanation nor comment. The ambition
of the one and the boyish weakness and vanity
of the other are well known. In selecting these as
the objects of his satirical allusions, the poet has not
treated them with greater severity than they deserved,
nor, indeed, than they have met with at
the hands of both contemporary and subsequent
historians.</p>

<p class="indent">As regards Maxwell, it is not difficult to account
for the prominence given to him, nor for the "unconstant
fayth and shamefull ways" with which he
is reproached. At the outbreak of hostilities he held
the office of Warden of the Western Border. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
confidence placed in him, however, he betrayed, not
only by allowing the insurgents to remain unmolested
within the district under his keeping, and
actually giving them entertainment, but also by
subscribing with them<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
and devoting a thousand pounds, which he had received from England, to the
equipment of a troop of horse for service against
his sovereign. Mary took his treason so greatly
to heart that, in a letter to Beton, Archbishop of
Glasgow, she inveighed in terms seldom to be met
with in her correspondence against "the traitor
Maxwell, who, to his great disgrace, had basely
violated his faith to her, and sent his son as his
pledge to England, undeterred by the remembrance
of the treatment to which his other boy was exposed,
of which he had told her himself".<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
After the Queen's bloodless victory over her rebellious nobles,
and the retreat of Moray and his associates from
their last city of refuge in Scotland, Maxwell, fearful
of the consequences of his own treasonable conduct,
begged to be allowed to return to his allegiance.
Three days after Mary's arrival at Dumfries, he was
brought before her by Bothwell and some of the
loyal lords who offered to become sureties for his
fidelity. He was received with generous kindness
by his sovereign, who not only granted him a free
pardon, but carried her magnanimity so far as to
accept the hospitality of his castle of Lochmaben,
where she remained until her return to Edinburgh.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
The couplet in which the satirist tells us how
Ledington "did powder it with pen, and fyled so
his sewgred speech as wone the wills of men",
pithily characterizes the secretary's conduct, not
merely on the special occasion to which allusion is
here made, but throughout the whole of his eventful
career. The other names introduced into the
passage are known to be those of noblemen who
embraced the Queen's cause, but the records of the
period make no reference to any acts of theirs of
sufficient importance to call for either praise or
censure, though the subsequent defection of some
of their number seems to justify the doubt cast
on the sincerity of their motives. With regard to
the last of these names, that of Bulford is probably
a corrupted form of some more familiar appellation.
It may possibly be intended to designate James
Balfour, Parson of Fisk, who "at this time", according
to John Knox, "had gottin all the guiding in
the Court" and "was preferred before all others,
save only the Erle of Athole".<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">With this black list of those who "prowld for
private pray", the poet contrasts the confederate
Lords by whom "right was erect and wilfull wronge
supprest", whose "judgements ever vncontrolde did
floryshe with the best", who "sought by civill
meanes for to advaunce the realme", but who were
"chast away" because "the Quene wold not abide
there grave advise that counsaled her to watch a
better tide". The names held up for special reverence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
are those of Murray, Hamilton, Argyle, Rothose,
Glencairn, Boyd, Ochiltree, and Grange, and it is
open to question whether their action, in revolting
from their sovereign and entering into negotiations
with Elizabeth and her agents, warrants the praise
bestowed upon them in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">Having thus recorded the relative strength and
merits of the contending parties, the poet completes
his picture of the lamentable state to which the kingdom
has been reduced by civil discord; then, with
his natural inclination to give prominence to his own
troubles, bewails the "unrest" which embitters his
life and is "powdering the heires upon his head".
For solace he "retyres unto his booke a space",
there to contemplate, "with rufull eye, what bale
is incident in everie estate where tirants do prevale",
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and to gather "examples that bloodye feicts dothe
aske vengiance and thrists for bloode againe".
Cyrus, Tomiris, Cambyses, Brutus, Cassius, Bessus,
Alexander, and Dionysius are called up "to represent
the fine of tirants' force", and to show "howe
the gwiltless bloode that is vniustlie shede dothe crave
revenge". Sheer weariness, however, puts an end
to the dismal meditation, and as the poet sinks into
"swete slepe" it seems to him that a messenger is
"thrust in at the doore" to inform him that the
Queen herself is at hand. Hereupon Mary enters,
and without further preface begins "her tale", to
which the second part of the <cite>Fantasie</cite> is devoted.</p>

<p class="indent">The opening words of the Queen's confession,
for such is the form into which her "complante"
is thrown, assume that she is acquainted with
Randolph's purpose of recording the events of which
he has been a witness, and are a request that he will
"inwrape her woos within his carefull clewe, that
when the recorde is spread everywhere, the state of
her comber first may appear". Her grief, however,
as she at once explains, is not for herself&mdash;there
is no cause why she should repine, for all
things have succeeded according to her will&mdash;it is
for the miserable state to which her headstrong resistance
to the advice of those who counselled wise
and moderate government has reduced her realm.
But, before entering fully into her subject, by a
clever paralepsy she digresses into an account of her
birth and accomplishments. Written as it is by
a professed enemy of Mary Stuart's the passage is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of considerable interest, and may help to settle the
disputed question of her personal gifts:&mdash;</p>

<p>Foremost amongst the defects that mar the high
gifts of nature she mentions the "Gwyssian" temper
which she has received from her mother, and by
which she has been led to take the first false step
"to wedd as she wold, suche a one as she demed
wold serve her lust rather then might her weale well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
upholde". The fatal marriage being thus introduced,
she naturally refers to its results, to the opposition
of those who, having "ever tendered her state,
cold not abyde to see this myscheffe", and whom,
in her ungovernable temper, in her "rigour and
hate", she "sought to subject to the sword". This
is followed by the names of her chief opponents,
the list being augmented by a few names which do
not appear in the first part. Here a passage of
singular significance even at the present day is
unexpectedly brought in, in connection with the
Duke of Argyle. It is a description of the Irish.
They are stigmatized "a bloody crewe that whoso
they take they helples downe hewe", and their barbarous
manner of carrying on war and inhuman
treatment of the enemy is thus set forth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This savage kinde, they knowe no lawe of armes,</span>
<span class="i0">they make not warrs as other do assay,</span>

<span class="i0">they hold it hopeles of the bodye dead</span>
<span class="i0">except they see hym cut shorter by the heade.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">From this point the Queen's "complante" becomes
a narrative&mdash;interspersed with moral reflections
on the dangers of despotic government and the
horrors of civil wars&mdash;of the victorious though bloodless
expedition against the confederate Lords. It
is noteworthy that, however depreciatory the judgment
which she is made to pass upon her own conduct,
her energy and courage are repeatedly insisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
upon in terms of unqualified praise: "The dread
of no enemy cold me appaile, nor yett no travell
endaunte my entent; ... I dreaded no daunger of
death to ensewe, no stormy blasts cold make me
retyre". Indeed, in one stanza she actually likens
herself to Tomiris, and though, from the fact that
it appears to be made by herself, the comparison at
first strikes us as unnatural and exaggerated, looked
at in its proper light, as the testimony of an avowed
enemy, it is undoubtedly a high tribute of admiration
to her indomitable spirit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="indent">The first episode referred to by the Queen is the
pitching of her camp near Glasgow, for the purpose
of intercepting the rebels who had taken up their
position near Paisley, but who, dismayed at the
rapid march of the royal army, hastily retired towards
Edinburgh. This was on August 31. The
poetical narrative is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">In a stanza following immediately upon this, and
descriptive of the course adopted by Mary on her
arrival in Edinburgh, we find the confirmation of a
statement made by Captain Cockburn,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
but indignantly denied as a shameless fabrication by those
historians whose aim it has been to clear the Queen
from every imputation. He asserts, not only that
she imposed a fine of &pound;20,000 on certain of the
burgesses of Edinburgh after the termination of the
expedition, but also that previously to this she had
extorted 14,000 marks from them for the support
of her army. It is the latter part of this statement
which has been challenged, but which undoubtedly
receives strong support from the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>

<span class="i0">to surpasse the yerelie revenue of my crowne.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Passing over the Queen's expedition into Fifeshire
and the capture of Castle Campbell, "the castle
of gloom", a formidable stronghold belonging to
her rebel brother-in-law, the Duke of Argyle, the
historical part of the narrative hastens on to the final
act, the march to Dumfries and the Lords' retreat
across the Border. The inglorious termination of
the rebellion has been pithily summed up by Sir
James Melville in his Memoirs: "Her Majesty
again convened forces to pursue the rebels, till at
length they were compelled to flee into England
for refuge, to her who promised by her ambassadors
to wear her crown in their defence, in case they
were driven to any strait for their opposition unto
the marriage".<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
The poet is scarcely less concise in
his record of an event which he could neither hide
nor gloss over, but upon which he evidently had no
wish to dwell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We came to Domfreis to attempt our might,</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">Though this seemed to indicate a point where the
<cite>Fantasie</cite> might come to a fitting close, it is drawn
out for fully a hundred lines in order that the moral
of the whole narrative may be duly brought home
to the reader. So far as Mary herself is concerned,
the gist of her long homily may be given in her
concluding words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">'Tis fittest for a prince,</span>
<span class="i0">and such as have the regyments of realmes,</span>

<span class="i0">do freshlie force the fragrant flowers to floryshe,</span>
<span class="i0">so rulers' mildness subjects love do noryshe.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The poet's own moralizing, with which, as with
an epilogue, the whole poem is brought to an end,
is wider in its application. The dangers which
beset greatness and the advantages which accompany
"golden mediocrity" are its leading theme, and are
set forth in a passage which brings together a number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of familiar illustrations drawn from inanimate nature:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Both the poem and the Epistle Dedicatory bear
the signature of Thomas Jenye. It is the name of
an unscrupulous adventurer who held some subordinate
position in the service of Thomas Randolph,
whilst he was in Scotland, and afterwards
of Sir Henry Norris, in the Netherlands. From
the literary point of view, the most noteworthy
feature of his <cite>Fantasie</cite> is the barefacedness with which
he pilfered, not only the ideas, but the actual words
of others. Indeed, in its introduction and conclusion,
which consist, for the most part, of moral
reflections, Jenye's satire is little better than a patchwork,
rather cleverly made up, it is true, of lines
purloined from Surrey, Grimsald, Sackville, and the
other writers who figure with them in <cite>Tottell's Miscellany</cite>.
But besides being a curiosity in plagiarism,
the <cite>Fantasie</cite> is a valuable historical document, by
reason of the accuracy with which it describes the
various incidents of Murray's revolt, of which Jenye
was practically an eyewitness.</p>

<h2>THE FIRST "STUART" TRAGEDY<br />AND ITS AUTHOR</h2>

<p class="indent">Mary, Queen of Scots, was beheaded in 1587.
Fourteen years later there was published in Rouen
a play which bore the title of <cite>Trag&eacute;die de la Reine
d'Escosse</cite>, and which had for its subject the condemnation
and death of Elizabeth's unfortunate
prisoner. The author styled himself Anthoine de
Montchrestien sieur de Vasteville; but it was alleged
by his enemies that he was nothing more aristocratic
than the son of an apothecary of Falaise called Mauchrestien.
He had, however, the good fortune to
be brought up, though in what connection is uncertain,
with two lads belonging to a family of
authentic nobility; and by the time he reached his
twentieth year, he had the training and education
of a gentleman of the period. With the sword
which he assumed as the emblem of the class to
which he claimed to belong, he adopted the fashionable
readiness to draw it on the slightest provocation.
His first recorded encounter, however, very nearly
proved his last. With the odds of three to one
against him, he was grievously wounded and left for
dead on the highway. But he recovered, and, in
the true spirit of a Norman, consoled himself for
his defeat and his injuries by suing the chief of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
adversaries, the Baron de Gouville. That he obtained
damages to the amount of 12,000 livres may
be taken as a proof that all the blame was not on
his side. The success of this legal action encouraged
him to take proceedings against one of his trustees,
who had failed to do his duty by him. A further
indemnity of 1000 livres was the result. About this
time, too, he married a rich widow whose good
graces he had previously secured by helping her to win
a lawsuit in which her husband had been the defender.</p>

<p class="indent">As early as 1596, Montchrestien had published
the tragedy of <cite>Sophonisbe</cite>. Five years later there
appeared a volume bearing his name, and containing
a miscellaneous collection of prose and verse, including
five tragedies, of which one was the Mary
Stuart play, with the running title of <cite>l'Escossoise</cite>.
In the midst of a literary success to which numerous
sets of complimentary verses testify, a real tragedy
changed the whole course of the Norman adventurer's
career. In a duel with a young nobleman,
he killed his adversary. Whether he did so in fair
fight or, as his detractors alleged, by means of a
disloyal stratagem, he was equally amenable to the
severe law against single combat which Henry IV
had lately promulgated. To no purpose did the
poet appeal to the king in some eloquent verses in
which he begged to be allowed to expiate his offence
by dying for his sovereign on the field of honour:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Arm&eacute; sur un cheval, en tenant une pique,</span>
<span class="i0">Non sur un &eacute;chafaud en vergogne publique."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
He was obliged to seek safety in exile, and retired
to England. There his "Stuart" tragedy was of
service to him. He presented it to James, who
showed his appreciation of the work by interceding
with the King of France on behalf of the author.
The result was favourable, but not immediate; and
several years had to elapse before the outlawry was
reversed.</p>

<p class="indent">Montchrestien had gone to England in the character
of a poet and a gentleman. He returned to
France to become an economist and manufacturer.
In 1615 he published a volume entitled, <cite>Traict&eacute; de
l'&OElig;conomie Politique</cite>. Never before had the term
been used; and the subject dealt with was as novel
as its name. Shortly after this, the founder of the
science for which such great destinies were in store,
established a cutlery on the banks of the Loire.
That his venture was successful seems hardly probable,
for less than four years later he was engaged
in the shipping trade. The story that he endeavoured
to better his financial position by the desperate
expedient of counterfeiting the coin of the
realm rests on no trustworthy authority, and may
be dismissed as one of the many calumnies by which
his enemies sought to blacken his memory after his
tragic death. That event took place in 1621; and
the various incidents that led up to it might well be
shaped into a novel of adventure, though they must
here be summarized in a few brief sentences. When
religious troubles again broke out in France, after
the Assembly of La Rochelle, Montchrestien threw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
in his lot with the Protestant party. He went about
for some months in his native province of Normandy,
endeavouring to organize an insurrection.
On the 7th of October he, together with his servant
and six Huguenot captains, was taken by surprise in
an inn. In the scuffle that followed, a pistol shot
through the head put an end to his adventurous
career. According to the barbarous custom which
then prevailed in France, as it did in Scotland also,
sentence was pronounced over his dead body. It was
burnt and the ashes were scattered to the winds.</p>

<p class="indent">When Montchrestien wrote <cite>l'Escossoise</cite>, six years
before the birth of Corneille, tragedy made no
attempt to depict the conflict of antagonistic passions,
but contented itself with the exposition of a pathetic
situation, considered from various points of view.
When this had been set forth with sufficient detail,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;nouement</i>, instead of being enacted before the
spectators, was indicated in a concluding narrative.
All Montchrestien's tragedies are drawn up on this
plan; and he is so faithful to the old classic form
that he retains even the chorus. It is worthy of
notice, however, that what has been called "dialogue
corn&eacute;lien", that quick alternation of antithetical
couplets and even single lines, suggestive of the
sharp clashing of swords in the hands of two well-matched
opponents, is one of the characteristics of
his manner, and is handled by him with considerable
skill and vigour.</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
In the Stuart tragedy the "entreparleurs" are the
Queen of Scots, the Queen of England, an anonymous
Councillor, Davison, a Master of the Household,
a Messenger, a Page, and two Choruses, one
composed of Mary's female attendants, and another
consisting of the "Estates" of England. The first
act is opened by Elizabeth, who, in a long speech
which she addresses to her Councillor, bewails her
hard fate and her precarious tenure of both crown
and life. She is particularly hurt at the ingratitude
of the Queen of Scots, whom she has deprived of
her liberty, it is true, but otherwise treated right
royally. And apostrophizing the rival whose fair face
hides so much disloyalty, envy, and spite, so much
fury and so much daring, she asks her whether her
heart is not touched at the thought of the countless
ills to which England must become a prey if it
should lose its lawful Sovereign.</p>

<p class="indent">Enlarging on this idea, the Councillor urges the
Queen to put her prisoner to death:&mdash;It is a pious
deed to kill a murderess; it cannot be displeasing
to a just God that punishment should be inflicted
on the wicked; and, moreover, has not the impunity
of vice often brought ruin and death on kingdoms
and on kings? To such arguments as these, Elizabeth
replies that kings and queens are answerable to God
alone; that Sovereigns who put their enemies to
death increase instead of diminishing their number;
and that severity only engenders hatred. And her
last words contain the half-expressed resolve to try
what clemency will do to disarm her rival. This
the Councillor meets with the significant question&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>To close the act the Chorus then appears and sings
the delights of the golden age and the simple life,
as compared with the troubles and anxieties that
embitter the existence of princes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
When the short second act opens, sentence of
death has been passed on Mary Stuart, and the
Estates of England appear before their Queen to
demand that, for their safety, the sentence shall be
carried out. Elizabeth accedes so far as to promise
that she will leave the matter in their hands. But
that is only a device to gain time. As soon as she
is by herself, she calls up a vivid picture of what
foreign nations and posterity will think of her if
she allows the blood of a Sovereign to stain the
scaffold, and is so horrified at it that she determines
to interfere. She leaves the stage and disappears
from the tragedy with the words:</p>

<p>In spite of the hopes inspired by Elizabeth, the next
act introduces Davison, who has been dispatched to
notify her sentence to the royal prisoner, and who,
in an effective monologue, expresses his sense of the
responsibility which he is incurring and of the odium
which he will be made to bear:</p>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">Davison is followed by Mary, whom her attendants
accompany. In a touching speech she tells the sad
story of her life&mdash;her unhappy childhood, her brief
reign in France, her return to her Scottish kingdom,
of which the distracted state is described in a few
vigorous lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="indent">To this accusation of having plotted the death of
her husband she replies with an impassioned apostrophe
to him, calling upon him to rise from the
dead and bear witness to her innocence. Then she
recalls her flight from Scotland, and, forgetful of
historical fact, attributes it to adverse fate and a
furious storm that she was obliged to land on the
inhospitable shores of the barbarous English:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="indent">And now that no hope of liberty remains, the
royal captive longs for the death which she believes
to have already been prepared for her. At this
point there is a really dramatic situation. The
sorrowing Queen has scarcely been assured by the
Chorus that her enemies will not dare proceed to
such extremes, when a page announces the approach
of a royal messenger. It is Davison. He has
come to make her death sentence known to the
prisoner, who welcomes it as the news of her
speedy deliverance.</p>

<p class="indent">The fourth act is a lofty elegy&mdash;Mary's farewell
to the world. The tender and touching lines with
which it opens indicate the spirit with which it is
animated throughout.</p>

<p>The lamentations of the Chorus close the pathetic
scene. This is not yet tragedy; but it is not far
from being splendid in parts. It is the work, if not
of a dramatist, at least of an eloquent rhetorician
combined with a lyric poet of high gifts. And when
it is remembered that the play was written before his
twenty-fifth year, by the man who afterwards showed
his keen power of analysis and his psychological
insight in his treatise on political economy, it is
justifiable to regret that the circumstances of his
adventurous life induced him to abandon the literary
career which had opened so auspiciously for him.</p>

<h2>LORETTO</h2>

<p class="indent">The original Loretto&mdash;or, as it should more correctly
be spelt, Loreto&mdash;is an Italian town situated in the
province of Ancona, and only a few miles from the
shores of the Adriatic. Its four to five thousand
inhabitants consist mainly of dealers in objects of
piety and in beggars, and its only importance lies in
the fame of its shrine, to which many thousands of
pilgrims resort yearly.</p>

<p class="indent">The cult of Our Lady of Loreto is based on one
of the most marvellous, not to say the most daring,
of medieval legends. According to the traditional
account, St. Helena, the mother of Constantine, had
caused a church to be built at Nazareth, over the
cottage which the Blessed Virgin had once inhabited.
That church the Saracens overthrew. They were
preparing to destroy the Santa Casa itself when, on
the night of May 12, 1291, angels, anticipating and
surpassing the feats of modern engineering, transported
it into Dalmatia. For various reasons it
was again removed three successive times from one
locality to another, until it finally took its stand on
the high road between Recanati and the sea. There
is a divergence of opinions as to the origin of the
name by which the magnificent shrine which shelters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the Santa Casa has become known through the
whole world. Some authorities attribute it to the
fact that the Holy House was deposited in a field
belonging to a widow called Lauretta, whilst others
connect it with the existence of a laurel grove on
the site chosen by the carrier angels. In addition
to the cottage, and within it, there is a statue of
the Madonna. It is attributed to St. Luke, whom
medieval legends commonly regarded as portraitist-in-ordinary
to the Virgin Mary. Another relic
consists of the dish out of which the Virgin ate.
The popularity which the shrine of Loreto acquired
through the ages may be estimated from the fact
that towards the end of the eighteenth century its
wealth was valued at more than a million sterling.
In 1797 Pius VI was obliged to draw on its treasury
in order to fulfil the conditions imposed on him by
the Treaty of Tolentino. War having again broken
out, the French occupied Loreto and took possession
of the miraculous statue, which was relegated to a
shelf beneath that occupied by a mummy in the
Cabinet des M&eacute;dailles of the Biblioth&eacute;que Nationale.
Napoleon restored it to the Pope in 1802.</p>

<p class="indent">The fame acquired by the Italian Loreto led to
the establishment, in other countries, of similar
shrines&mdash;branch establishments for the granting of
indulgences and the performance of miracles. Of
such Scotland possessed at least two. One of them,
which does not seem to have acquired more than a
local reputation, was in Perth. The other stood
"beyond the eastern gate of Musselburgh and on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the margin of the links". The date and circumstances
of its foundation are set forth by the <cite>Diurnal
of Remarkable Occurrents</cite>, which, amongst the entries
for 1533, has the following:&mdash;"In this mene tyme
thair came ane heremeit, callit Thomas Douchtie, in
Scotland, quha haid bein lang capitane (?captive)
before the Turk, as was allegit, and brocht ane
ymage of our Lady with him, and foundit the
Chappel of Laureit, besyid Musselburgh". In addition
to this evidence there is a charter of James V,
dated July 29, 1534, and confirming the grant by
the Bailies, of a "petra" of land in the territory of
Musselburgh, to Thomas Duthy, of the Order of
St. Paul, first hermit of Mount Sinai, for the erection
of a chapel in honour of Almighty God and of
Blessed Mary of Laureto.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Beside sanctioning the foundation of the shrine,
James gave it a tangible proof of his patronage.
In August, 1534, as is shown by the Accounts of
the Lord High Treasurer, he spent &pound;22, 13<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>
in purchasing the materials and paying for the
making and ornamenting of albs, amices, stoles,
chasubles, and altar towels.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
We learn from John Lesley, Bishop of Ross, that, in 1536, before setting
out on his voyage to France for the purpose of
bringing home the Lady Magdalene as his bride,
the King, being in Stirling, "passit thairfra on his
feitt, in pilgrimag to the Chappell of Lorrett, besid
Mussilburgh". This statement is borne out by an
entry in the <cite>Liber Emptorum</cite>: "Hodie (9th August),
soluto disjunio, rex pedestre peregrinavit de Stirling
versus Sanctam Mariam de Laureit et pernoctabat in
Edinburgh".<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
The Accounts supply the further information that on this occasion he
made a gift of four altar towels, two of "Dornik", that is, of the
diapered linen cloth manufactured at Tournay, and
two of bleached Breton canvas. Including twenty
shillings "for sewing of XX crocis upoun the
saidis towellis", the expense incurred amounted to
&pound;6, 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The sum of fourteen shillings was
left with the "chapellanis of Lawrete to pray for
the Kingis Grace"; and a further offering of two
crowns was made after the actual embarkation at
Newhaven.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>

Thomas Duthie's foundation throve under the
influence of royal favour, and from all parts of the
country, pilgrimages to the shrine were performed,
as Sir David Lyndsay testifies:</p>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">According to Row's <cite>History of the Kirk of Scotland</cite>,
the popularity of the Musselburgh shrine was enhanced
by the claim that it possessed, in addition
to its general healing powers, a special obstetrical
virtue, of which women secured the benefits by
sending handsome presents to the priest and friars.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
That Duthie was a personage of some importance
in his day may be gathered from the fact that the
Earl of Glencairn wrote a "pasquinal" which Knox
and Calderwood have preserved and which was entitled
"Ane Epistill direct frae the halie Hermeit of
Alareit to his Brethren the Gray Friars". But the
success of his venture engendered envy, and Calderwood
tells, with many caustic comments, how John
Scott, "a landed man", having failed to get himself
accepted as a partner in the Loretto concern, set up
in competition with it. This John Scott had had a
strange career, of which the sketch given by the historian,
in his quaint language, is interesting enough
to be reproduced. "Before his departure out of this
country, he had succumbed in an action of law, and
because he was not able to pay the sum which the
other party had evicted, he took sanctuary at Holyroodhouse.
There he abstained from meat and
drink certain days. The bruit of his abstinence
coming to the King's ears, the King caused put him
into David's tower, in the Castle of Edinburgh, and
bread and water to be set beside him. He abstained
from eating and drinking thirty-two days. When
he was let forth, the people came flocking to him.
He uttered many idle speeches, and among the rest,
that by the help of the Blessed Virgin, he could fast
suppose never so long time. He went to Rome,
where he was committed to prison, by Pope Clement,
till trial was taken of his abstinence. He is set at
liberty, and a sealed testimonial granted to him, with
a seal of lead, and some mass clothes. After he had
given the like proof at Venice, he got fifty ducats to
supply his charges to Jerusalem. He brought with
him from Jerusalem some date-tree leaves, and a
pocke full of stones, which he fained were taken out
of the pillar to which Christ was bound when he was
scourged. By the way, when he was at London,
he made an harangue against King Henry's divorce,
and shaking off the Pope's authority, at Paul's Cross.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
He was thereupon committed to prison, but was set
at liberty, after he had been keeped fifty days, all
which space he abstained from meat and drink." It
was on his return to Scotland, shortly after this, that
Scott tried to get himself associated to Duthie. His
overtures having been rejected, he "erected an altar
in a chamber near Edinburgh, whereon he set his
daughter, a young maid, and wax candles about
her burning, to be worshipped in place of the Virgin
Mary".<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
But the fame of Loretto was proof against
such competition, and Scott had to retire from the
unequal contest with Duthie.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1544, the Chapel of Our Lady of Lauret,
together with a part of Musselburgh, was "brennt
and desolated" by the English army under the Earl
of Hertford. The shrine was rebuilt, however, and
continued to attract devotees till the Restoration
closed it. Very shortly before this, its prestige is
said to have suffered greatly from the alleged discovery
of a fraud practised by its priests in pretending
to have restored the sight of a boy whom they falsely
affirmed to have been born blind.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
The whole incident is set forth at great length in
Row's <cite>History</cite>. The hero of the story is Robert
Colvill, Laird of Cleishe, who was commonly known
as Squire Meldrum, and who, on that account, has
sometimes been mistaken for the character celebrated
by Lyndsay. He is described as "a gentleman of
good understanding and knowledge, sound in the
Reformed religion, and most zealous and stoute for
the Reformation". But his wife, one of the
Colquhouns of Luss, was a Catholic, and finding
herself in need of such help as "the Ladie and
Saints of Allarite" were supposed to have it in
their power to give, she posted off her servant
"with ane offering of gold, with her sarke (according
to the custome), that shee might get easie delyverie".
Her husband learning this, also hurried
off, with the intention of hindering such a superstitious
use of his money. He rode all the way to
Loretto, however, without overtaking the messenger;
and, on his arrival at the shrine, he was no less
scandalized than surprised to find "the whole adjacent
countrey of Mers, Tweedale, East, Middle, and
West Lothians, convened to see ane miracle", the
performance of which had been announced for that
very day. "For the Papists, perceiving the Reformation
to goe on quicklie, and fearing that their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
religion should be abandoned, the kirkmen, the
Archbishops, Bishops, Preists, Freires, &amp;c., consulted
and advysed, and, after deliberation, resolved, that
the best wayes to maintaine and uphold their Religion,
wes to worke some miracle to confirme the
people, (as they thought) that Poperie wes the true
religion; and, therefore, they caused proclame in
Edinburgh that on such a day there wes a great
miracle to be wrought at St. Allerite's Chapell, for
a man that wes borne blind, and had begged all his
dayes, being a blind man, wes to be cured and receive
his sight."</p>

<p class="indent">Such was the performance for which Squire Meldrum
had arrived in time. And, indeed, he saw
how an apparently blind beggar was brought forward
on to a platform, and how, after certain ceremonies
had been gone through, he seemed to recover the
use of his eyes, and came down rejoicing amongst
the people, who gave him money. But the Squire
was not to be so easily convinced. On the contrary,
he determined "to doe his best to find out the lurking
deceit whereby the people were miserablie deceived".
With this object in view, when the beggar,
in whose way he contrived to put himself, asked him
for a dole, he gave him not only an exceptionally
large sum of money, but sympathetic words as well.
"You are a verie remarkable man," he said, "on
whom such a miracle has been wrought, I will have
you to goe with me to be my servant." The beggar
readily agreed, and mounting on horseback behind
the Squire's attendant, rode off with his new master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
to Edinburgh. When the party reached Meldrum's
lodgings, matters took a new turn. Locking the
door upon himself and his new servant, drawing his
sword, and assuming "a fierce countenance", the
Squire said to the man: "Thou villane and deceiver
of the people of God, either tell me the treuth of
these things that I am to aske of you now presentlie,
or els I will take upon me, with my sword, to cutt
off thy head; for I am ane magistrate appointed by
God to doe justice; and I am assured that all the
preists and freirs, all the saints, nor the Pope himselfe,
cannot work a miracle such as they pretend to
do, namely, to cure a blind man. Therefor thou and
they are but deceivers of the people; and either tell
me the veritie, or els with this sword I will presentlie&mdash;as
ane magistrate in this case&mdash;put ye to death."
The poor wretch, thus taken unawares and terrified
out of all thought of resistance, consented to do and
to say whatever might be required of him. And the
remarkable story which he told is reported in what
professes to be his own language:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"When I wes a young lad I wes a herd, and
keeped the Sisters of the Sheines's sheep, and in my
wantonness and pastime I used often to flype up the
lids of my eyes, so that any bodie wold have trewed
that I wes blind. I using often to play this pavie,
the nunnes, the Sisters of the Sheines (so they were
commonly called), did sometymes see me doe it and
laugh at me. Then the Sisters send in word to
Edinburgh that their sheppeard lad could play such
a pavie. The kirkmen in Edinburgh hearing of such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
a thing, came out to the Sheines, and desired to see
that sheppeard lad. I being brought and playing
this pavie befor them, walking up and doune with
my eyelids up, and the whyte of my eyes turned up
as if I had been blind. The kirkmen that conveened
there to see me, advised the Sisters, the Nunnes of
the Sheines, to get another lad to keep their sheep,
and to keep me hid in one of their volts or cellars
for some years, ay till they thought meet to bring
me out, and to make use of me as they pleased, and
so, Sir, I wes keeped and fed in one of the volts, no
bodie knowing that I wes there but the kirkmen and
the Nunnes of the Sheines, for the space of seven or
eight years. Then, Sir, they conveened me againe,
and brought me befor them, and caused me sweare a
great oath that I sould faine my selfe to be a blind
man, and they put one to lead me through the
countrey that I might beg as a blind man in the day
tyme; but in the night, and also when I pleased, I
put doune my eyelids and saw well enough, and I to
this houre never revealed this to any; yea, my leader
knew not but I wes blind indeed."</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning Squire Meldrum and the detected
impostor, in accordance with a plan carefully devised
by the former, betook themselves to the Mercat
Crosse. There, after having attracted the attention
of the public by thrice repeating the accustomed cry
of "O yes!" the erstwhile blind beggar recited a
speech which Meldrum had prepared for him, and
in which he gave those who had seen the miraculous
cure of the day before all the details of the fraud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
which he had helped to practise on them. Then,
springing on to horses that were held in readiness
for them, Meldrum and he galloped away towards
Queensferry, on their way to Fifeshire, where they
could depend on the protection of the Lords of the
Congregation, and where they might defy "the
preists, freiers, and the rest of that deceiving rabble".<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
And with this incident there is an end to the story
of Loretto as a wonder-working shrine.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a charter which shows that, in 1569,
Gavin Walker, "Chapline of the Chaplainerie of
Loretto",<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
restored to the town the ground originally
granted by it to Thomas Duthie. According
to the brief notice contributed by "Jupiter" Carlyle
to the old <cite>Statistical Account</cite>, the Chapel was demolished
in 1590, and the materials were utilized
for the building of a new tolbooth. He states that
"this is said to have been the first religious house
in Scotland whose ruins were applied to an unhallowed
use". That is not improbable. But when
"Jupiter" goes on to record that for this act "the
good people of Musselburgh are said to have been
annually excommunicated, till very lately, at Rome",
he helps to perpetuate a tradition of which his own
common sense might have shown him the improbability&mdash;not
to use a harsher term.</p>

<h2>THE ISLE OF MAY</h2>
<h3>I</h3>

<p class="indent">The May, situated at the entrance to the Firth of
Forth, is the largest of the islets that stud the waters
of the estuary between the coast of Fife and that of
the Lothians. It lies ten miles to the north-east of
Dunbar, and five to the south-west of Fifeness. Its
greatest length is from east to west, and measures
about a mile. Its width is greatest at the western
extremity, and may be estimated at rather more than
half a mile. The shape of the island is exceedingly
irregular. At the south-western point a mass of
precipitous rock gives it an imposing and picturesque
appearance, but to the east and to the north
the cliffs terminate abruptly, and are flanked by
stretches of comparatively low-lying coast. Between
their respective extremities the seaboard, which faces
the north-east, is rugged and difficult of access, but
does not otherwise present a striking outline.</p>

<p class="indent">In former days there were four landing-places,
known as Tarpithol, Altarstanes, Pilgrims-haven,
and Kirk-haven. At present there are but two.
One of them is on the western side, where a gully,
forming a kind of natural harbour, has been provided
with a ladder, which is not, however, always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
available to large boats, and at certain states of the
tide access to the island involves a considerable
amount of clambering over the rocks. The other
is situated on the north-east shore. It consists of
a wharf, or rather slip, built at the head of one of
the many coves. Its depth of water is less than
that of the western harbour, but it has the advantage
of being more sheltered.</p>

<p class="indent">The surface of May Island is uneven, but covered
in most parts with excellent turf; and, according
to Sibbald, its name, "which in the ancient Gothic
signifieth a green island", was given to it "because
of its commodiousness for pasture, for it is all green
grass". According to the same writer, it was supposed
to afford ample sustenance for a hundred sheep
and some twenty cows, and was let as a grazing
ground for &pound;26 per annum. In the <cite>Statistical Account
of Scotland</cite>, published in 1792, the Reverend James
Forrester states, on the authority of a "very intelligent
farmer", who had dealt in sheep for above
thirty years, and who had had them from all the
different corners of Scotland, that there is no place
so well adapted for improving wool as the Island of
May; that the fleeces of the coarsest-woolled sheep
that ever came from the worst pasture in Scotland,
when put on the island, became as fine as satin in
the course of one season; that their flesh had also
a superior flavour; and that rabbits bred on the
May had a finer fur than those which were reared
on the mainland.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
The waters in the neighbourhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of the isle were long famous for their abundance of
fish; and an old writer states that, in his time, many
seals were slain on the east side of it.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
At the present day the seals have wholly disappeared, and the
fishing grounds are practically deserted. In a few
of the more sheltered spots some attempt at cultivation
has been made, but the result hardly seems
to repay the labour. One feature which has always
been considered of special importance is the possession
of fresh water. The names of five wells are
given&mdash;the Lady's Well, the Pilgrim's Well, St.
John's Well, St. Andrew's Well, and the Sheep
Well; but the water is not equally good in all.
The most accessible is not far from the western
landing-place, and by the side of the cart road that
runs through the length of the island. A small
lake mentioned by Sibbald is still to be seen, and
is utilized.</p>

<p class="indent">Ecclesiastically the Isle of May belongs to the
parish of Anstruther-Wester; and in the days when
it was inhabited by fourteen or fifteen families, the
minister of the mother church was supposed to visit
them once every year.</p>

<p class="indent">The earliest description of the Isle of May is
given by Jean de Beaugu&eacute;, a French gentleman
who came to Scotland in 1548 in the company of
Monsieur de Dess&eacute;, the leader of the forces sent
over by Henry II in support of the party that
opposed the aggressive policy of England. His
account represents the island as possessing coal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
mines, stone quarries, excellent pasturage, and abundant
springs of fresh water, and as being admirably
suited to afford safe anchorage to thirty or forty
ships. If it were fortified and inhabited, he says,
the Scotch and those foreigners who traded with
them might navigate freely, without being reduced
to the necessity of waiting for favourable winds to
enable them to sail from Leith or Burntisland. By
this means the whole country would derive immediate
benefit from the proximity of an island that
had hitherto served no better purpose than that of
affording a convenient retreat to all the pirates who
infested the coast, and who not only interfered with
the fisheries and with the trade, but also harassed the
armaments of the Scotch and of their allies.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">In Hector Boece's account of Scotland there is but
a brief reference to the Isle of May "amang mony
uther ilis" in the Firth of Forth. He mentions, as
a natural curiosity, that, "in the middis of this Ile
there springis ane fontane of fresche and purifyit
water outhrow ane roche crag, to the gret admiratioun
of peple, considerin it lyis in the middis of the
seis". But its chief distinction, in his eyes, is that
it was "decorit with the blude and martirdome of
Sanct Adriane and his fallowis".<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The history, or, as it is perhaps more correct to call
it, the legend of Adrian the Martyr of the May, is
to be found in the Breviary of Aberdeen. It is there
stated that he was born in the parts of Hungary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and in the province of Pannonia, that he was of
royal descent and of episcopal rank, and that his
diligence in the sacred order was testified by the
many clerics and seculars who were his companions.
Desiring to benefit other nations, and inflamed with
zeal for the Christian religion, Adrian betook himself
to the eastern parts of Scotia, then occupied by
the Picts, having along with him six thousand six
hundred and six companions, among whom the most
noteworthy were Glodiarus, who was crowned with
martyrdom; Gayus and Monarus, white-robed confessors;
Stobrandus, and other bishops adorned with
the mitre. The names of the rest are written in
purple blood in the Book of Life.</p>

<p class="indent">These holy men wrought many signs and wonders
in the midst of the Picts; but at length, desiring a
habitation of their own, they expelled the demons
and wild beasts from the Island of May, and there
made a place of prayer. They gave themselves up
to devotion until the Danes, after devastating all
Britannia, which is now called Anglia, landed on the
island, when the holy confessors of God opposed
them with the spiritual weapons of heavenly warfare.
The enemy, not brooking their zealous preaching
and their increasing confession of the most glorious
name of Christ, rushed with their swords on the
Blessed Adrian, the victim of the Lord, and crowned
him with a glorious martyrdom. And in order that,
concerning them, the words of the prophet should
be verified anew, where the disconsolate Rachel is
said to have bewailed her children, those most cruel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
executioners fell upon the holy and heavenly multitude
who persevered in confessing Christ, and who,
like sheep, fell under their swords in the Isle of
May, where the martyrs of God, who, in this life,
loved to serve him together, in death were not
separated. There was one spirit in them and one
faith. In that Isle of May there was anciently
erected a monastery of well-hewn stone, which was
destroyed by the Angles. But the church remains
to this day, much visited for its miracles by the
people, and women who go thither in the hope of
offspring are not disappointed. There is also a
famous cemetery, where the bodies of the martyrs
repose. Such is the account of the Breviary.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
The date ascribed to the event narrated in it is the fourth
day of March, in the year 875.</p>

<p class="indent">In his <cite>Cronykil of Scotland</cite> Andrew Wyntoun sums
up the legend in the following lines:</p>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">It may be incidentally mentioned that another
saint, Mungo, the patron of Glasgow, is slightly
and indirectly connected with the May. According
to legend, St. Thenaw's father ordered her to be
stoned and cast in a chariot from the top of Taprain
Law, in punishment of her supposed sin. Having
been miraculously preserved from destruction, she
was then accused of witchcraft, and the father was
urged by his heathen subjects to expose her in a
boat made of twigs and pitch and covered with
leather. In this coracle she was carried out to the
Ile of May, whence, attended by a company of fishes,
she was wafted to Culross, where she gave birth to
St. Mungo.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
There may not impossibly be some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
connection between this legend and the efficacity
subsequently attributed to pilgrimages to the May
when performed by women; and it is said to be
from St. Thenaw that various spots in the island&mdash;the
Lady's Well, the Lady's Bed, the Maiden Rocks,
and the Maiden's Hair&mdash;are called.</p>

<p class="indent">It is usually stated that the monastery to which
the Breviary of Aberdeen makes reference was
founded by King David, and that he bestowed it
upon the monks of Reading, in England, as a
"cell", or dependency of their great abbey. But,
as Dugdale points out, there is no actual proof of
this in that monarch's charters. By the first of them
he merely gives to the Church of May, and to the
Prior and monks of the same place, a certain toft in
Berwick in perpetual alms for the sake of his soul
and the souls of his ancestors and successors; and
by the second he enlarges his donation by gifts in
Balegallin and other places, to hold, indeed, of him
and of his heirs, but without any indication that he
was the founder. At the same time, it must be
admitted that the silence of the charters is no convincing
proof of the contrary.</p>

<p class="indent">King William, grandson of David, confirmed to
God and the Church of All Saints of May, and to
William, the Prior, and to his successors, brethren
of the Cluniac order, in free and perpetual alms,
the donations made by his grandfather David, of
pious memory, and by his predecessor and brother,
King Malcolm. The contribution of the latter sovereign
to these benefactions appears to have been the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
grant of a toll of five marks by the year from ships
arriving at Perth. King William also enjoins all
persons fishing round the Island of May to pay
their due tithes to God and the aforesaid church
without reserve. He also commands that no one
shall unjustly detain from them the tithes to which
they were entitled in the time of King David, on
pain of forfeiture; nor shall anyone presume to fish
in their waters, to construct buildings on the Isle of
May, to dig land, or to cut grass there, without their
licence. He moreover grants and confirms to them
one mansion, with a toft in Dunbar, and the use
of a vessel for transporting the necessaries of their
household, as Earl Gospatric had granted, and King
Malcolm confirmed to them. By later charters he
bestows upon the Priory a grant of fourpence from
all ships having four hawsers, coming to the ports
of Pittenweem and Anstruther for the purpose of
catching or selling fish, and also from boats with
fixed helms. Of the "can" or duty collected at
those ports he enjoins that the tenth penny shall
be paid to the monks, but reserves the bulk for
himself. He also gives them the lands of Petother,
and further shows his goodwill towards them by
exempting the men dwelling on their lands from
military service&mdash;de exercitu et expeditione&mdash;and
also from the payment of can and toll, and by
extending the latter privilege to all who come to
fish in their waters.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
It was not only to the liberality of their kings
that the Monks of the May were indebted for the
extensive and valuable lands which they owned on
both sides of the firth. From Gospatric, the powerful
Border Earl, they received a toft near his harbour
of Bele. To this his successor, Patrick, Earl
of Dunbar, added five acres of land near the same
harbour. He also made over to them all the land
"from Windydure to Kingissete, and so by the
footpath coming down to Kingsburn, and from
thence up by the high road which goes by the
Rede Stane and by that road to Windydure, with
common pasture". In addition to this he released
them from the annual payment of a cow, which they
had made till then for the lands which they held
from him in Lambermor.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Another benefactor, whose liberality is recorded
in the Registry of the Priory of St. Andrews, was
John Fitz-Michael. From him the monks got the
lands of Mayschelis, in the Lambermor, on the
south side of Calwerburne, together with an acre
of meadow, and with pasture sufficient for three
hundred mother sheep, thirty bearing cows, and
twenty-four brood mares with their young. They
were, further, to have ten sows with their brood in
Fitz-Michael's pasture; and the men living on the
land were allowed the privilege of taking as much
peat and turf as was necessary for use in their own
houses. To complete this handsome donation, it
was declared free from all hosting, service, exaction,
and multure.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
The lands of Ardarie, in Fife, consisting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of a carucate and a bovate, were made over
to the prior and monks of May by William of
Beaueyr, in perpetual alms, for the salvation of
Countess Ada, of Malcolm the King, her son, and
of William, the reigning sovereign. The island
community was also to have the reversion of two
bovates which William had given in dowry to his
wife, and of one bovate which he had granted in
life tenure to his sergeant, Ralph.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
From Eggou Ruffus the monks received some land adjoining his
own property of Lingoch; whilst Alexander Cumyn,
Earl of Buchan, made a yearly donation of a stone
of wax, or forty shillings, to be received at Rossy,
at the fair of St. Andrew. Finally, a part of the
Moor of Barewe, extending westwards from the foot
of the hill of Whitelawe, was gifted to the priory by
Gilbert of Saint Martin.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">But, besides the records which thus testify to the
esteem in which the Monks of May were held, and
to the substantial marks of favour granted them by
munificent patrons, there also exist documents which
tell of less friendly relations between them and other
landowners on the mainland, and of protracted litigation
with rival claimants. Thus, an agreement
arrived at in the year 1260, between the community
on the one side and Sir John de Dundemore on the
other, with regard to the ownership of the lands of
Turbrech, in Fife, refers to the "many altercations"
to which the question had given rise, and sets forth
the terms of settlement arrived at by the contending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
parties. Sir John was to make over to the monks
the contested property, in "free and perpetual alms,
for the weal of his soul and the souls of his predecessors
and of his successors". In return for this
substantial concession, the Prior and Brethren undertook
to grant him and his heirs in perpetuity a
monk to perform divine service for them in the
Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In addition
to this, they bound themselves to pay him, at their
own option, either half a mark of silver yearly, or
sixty "mulwelli"&mdash;probably haddock. If they chose
to make payment in kind, the fish were to be supplied
in two instalments&mdash;thirty at Whitsuntide and
thirty at Martinmas. They further granted him
and his heirs a glass lamp in the church of Ceres,
with two gallons of oil, or twelve pence, yearly, for
feeding it. The Lairds of Dundemore do not appear
to have been altogether satisfied with the terms
of a compromise which, so far as material interests
were concerned, was obviously one-sided. As a
protest against the total alienation of the lands of
Turbrech, Henry de Dundemore demanded that
the Prior of the May should swear fealty to him
on account of them. The claim, which nothing in
the charter formerly granted by Sir John seems to
have justified, was resisted, whereupon Henry, compensating
himself in a high-handed and tangible
manner, distrained a horse belonging to the monks.
The matter was referred to William, Bishop of St.
Andrews. His decision is contained in a document
dated in Cupar, on the first Monday after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Purification of the Blessed Virgin, in the year of the
Lord 1285. It is wholly adverse to the layman,
whom it orders to restore the horse, within eight
days, to its rightful owners.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="indent">In the year 1242 we find the House of May
appealing to the Court of the Archdeaconry of
Lothian against the encroachment of an ecclesiastic.
The case for the monks was that Adam Black, of
Dunbar, had bequeathed to them a house and croft,
together with two "perticates" of arable land, but
that, at his death, the property in question had been
occupied and unjustly detained by Patrick, Chaplain
of Dunbar. When the matter came before the
authorities, Patrick could not deny the justice of
the claim put forward. That he himself was not
without some justification for the course he had
taken is suggested by the decision of the Court.
It was that he should remain in possession of the
house and grounds, but should make to the Priory
a payment of three shillings a year for them. This
settlement was made by William Mortimer as representing
the Bishop of St. Andrews, and by Baldred,
Dean of Lothian, within the parish church of Haddington,
in presence of the incumbent and of the
vicar of North Berwick.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
When David I conveyed the Priory of May to
the Monks of Reading, he also granted them the
lands of Rindalgros, in Perthshire, where another
cell for monks was erected, subject to the House
of May. Here, too, questions of property and privilege
brought the monks into conflict with their
neighbours. Thus, between them and Duncan of
Inchesiryth a dispute arose with regard to their respective
fishing rights. The matter was so adjusted
that both parties should be entitled to cast their nets
in the contested waters, as it might suit them, and
with no further restriction than the common use of
the country.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The records of the Priory also furnish details of
disputes that arose between the Monks of May and
other religious houses. Thus, in 1231, a case in
which they were the pursuers came before a commission
appointed by the Pope, and consisting of
the Prior and of the Archdeacon of St. Andrews,
together with the Dean of Fife. They complained
that, although the church of Rind, with the teinds
of the whole parish, belonged in property to them,
the Brethren of Scone detained from them the tithes
of four fishings&mdash;namely, of Sleples, Elpenslau,
Chingil, and Inchesiryth&mdash;all situated within the
bounds of the parish. After hearing the pleadings,
allegations, and exceptions of both parties, the judges
and their legal assessors decided that, for the sake
of peace, the Monks of Scone should pay two merks
of silver yearly to the House of May, and should,
in return, be held free from all claims for the tithes.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
A few years before this, in 1225, the Prior and
Brethren of the May were themselves the defendants
in an action raised by the House of Dryburgh.
From the official statement of the case it appears
that the Parish Church of Anstruther belonged to
the former and that of Kilrenny to the latter, and
that the two parishes were separated from each other
by a stream. In view of the fact that the boats
which fished in this stream were moored on the
Kilrenny side and that their anchors were fixed
within the bounds of the parish, where they remained
for the night, the Canons of Dryburgh
maintained that they were entitled to one-half of
the tithes arising from such boats, whilst the Monks
of May levied the whole. The Abbot and the Prior
of Melrose and the Dean of Teviotdale, acting as
Papal Commissioners, decided that, "for the sake
of peace, the Monks of May should pay yearly one
merk of silver within the Parish Church of Kilrenny
to the Canons of Dryburgh, for which payment the
monks were to be free of all claim on the part of
the canons, providing the latter should receive full
tithes from their proper parishioners&mdash;that is, from
the parishioners receiving spiritual benefits in the
church of Kilrenny and using the said part of the
shore; and that the monks should receive full tithes
from all coming from other quarters, and using the
said part of the shore".<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Amongst the documents relating to the May there
is one which records an agreement arrived at between
the Prior and Convent on the one hand and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Malcolm, the King's Cupbearer, on the other, with
regard to the Chapel of Ricardestone. The monks
authorized the celebration of mass in the chapel by
a chaplain from the House of Rindalgros, or some
other in his stead, on every Sunday, Wednesday, and
Friday, as well as on the principal feast days, such
being Christmas and the three days after it, the
Purification, Easter, the Ascension, Pentecost, the
Assumption, the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, and
All Saints. They also permitted that the holy bread&mdash;that
is to say, the loaf offered by the people,
blessed by the priest before the beginning of the
mass, and distributed amongst the congregation&mdash;should
be given there, but only by the men of the
vill. There, too, the women of the vill&mdash;but they
alone&mdash;might be churched, and also be heard in
confession; but they were to pay the offering for
wax to the Mother Church of Rindalgros, and there,
too, were to receive communion at Easter. The
Cupbearer himself and all his successors were to be
at liberty to communicate either in the chapel or
in the Mother Church. Malcolm might also have
a priest attached to his chapel, provided such priest
acknowledged submission to the Church of Rindalgros.
In return for these concessions and privileges,
the Cupbearer not only confirmed the gifts of land
made by his father to the chapel, but also added a
grant of other four acres in pure and perpetual alms.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Apart from such incidents as the Records of the
Priory of May indicate, there seems to have been
only one event of importance in connection with it
for more than a century from the time when King
David conveyed it to the Monks of Reading, on
condition that they should maintain in it nine
priests of their brethren, to offer up the Mass for
the benefit of his soul and of the souls of his predecessors
and successors, Kings of Scotland. It is
briefly referred to by the chronicler Torf&aelig;us in his
account of one of Swein Asleif's expeditions. Steering
southwards, he says, Swein and his followers
arrived at the Isle of May. In that island there
was a monastery, the abbot of which was named
Baldwin. Being detained there for seven days, they
professed to be ambassadors from Earl Ronald to
the King of Scotland. The monks, suspecting them
to be robbers, sent to the mainland for help. On
this, Swein plundered the monastery, and took
much booty. As a strangely inconsistent sequel
to this story, Torf&aelig;us adds that Swein then sailed
up the Firth of Forth, and found King David in
Edinburgh; that the King received Swein with
much honour, and entreated him to remain; and
that Swein told David all that had occurred between
him and Earl Ronald, and how he had plundered
the Isle of May. The same historian also states
that on another occasion Swein anchored at the Isle
of May, from which he dispatched messengers to
the King at Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Spottswood states, in his <cite>List of Religious Houses in Scotland</cite>,
that the Priory of the May, originally
put under the patronage of All Saints, was subsequently
consecrated to the memory of St. Adrian.
He does not, however, mention on what occasion.
He adds that William Lamberton, Bishop of St.
Andrews, purchased it from the Abbot of Reading,
and notwithstanding the complaints made thereupon
by Edward Longshanks, King of England, bestowed
it upon the canons regular of his cathedral. Fordun
and Prynne both give details of the transaction; but
from documents discovered at a later date and published
in the <cite>Records of the Priory of the Isle of May</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
it appears that neither of them states the case quite
fully nor quite correctly. It is to be gathered from
the proceedings relative to the claim of the Abbot
and Convent of Reading on the Priory, that it was
Robert de Burghgate, Abbot of Reading, who sold
the Scottish "cell" to William, Bishop of St.
Andrews, and that he received from him 1100
merks on account of the price. It would seem,
however, that he effected this transaction contrary
to the wish of the majority of his monks; and, on
this ground, his successor, Abbot William, attempted
to overturn it. In the Parliament of John Baliol,
held at Scone on the 10th of February, 1292, John
Sutton and Hugh Stanford, appearing as his representatives,
demanded either possession of the Priory
of May or payment of the balance of the price
agreed to be paid for it, together with the fruits and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
rents accruing from it during the preceding four
years. Failing recognition of their claims, they were
empowered to appeal to the judgment of the King
of England&mdash;a significant instruction which shows
that Edward intended to turn the dispute to account
in the prosecution of his designs against the independence
of Scotland.</p>

<p class="indent">When the English representatives presented their
abbot's petition they were asked whether he was
prepared to repay to the Bishop of St. Andrews
the 1100 merks already received on account. They
cautiously replied that they had not been sent to
make any payment, and could not undertake to do
so; and they requested that the case, which had been
brought to a deadlock by reason of the Scottish
counterclaim, might be adjourned to the next, or
to some subsequent Parliament, so that they might
have time to consult both the Abbot of Reading and
the English King. To escape from the necessity
of either recognizing or challenging the sovereign
authority which Edward claimed, and by virtue of
which it was intended to get the dispute settled in
favour of the Monks of Reading, the Bishop of St.
Andrews, on his side, appealed to the Roman See.
The case being thus removed from the Scottish
Court, Baliol had a plausible reason for refusing to
proceed further in the matter. The English abbot's
attorneys were not, however, satisfied with this move
on the part of their opponents. Alleging a denial
of justice in the Scottish Court, they appealed to
King Edward as Lord Superior of the Kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of Scotland. He consequently issued a writ, dated
at Dunton on the 2nd of September, 1293, by which
he cited John Baliol to appear before him within a
fortnight of the feast of St. Martin. Baliol disregarded
not only this first summons, but also two
others, which respectively called upon him to appear
within the octave of the feast of the Holy Trinity,
and within a month after Easter. A fourth writ
was then forwarded to the Sheriff of Northumberland.
It was to be served by him in person on the
Scottish King, whom it commanded to appear before
his suzerain within a month after Michaelmas, and
to bring with him the record of the proceedings in
the Scottish Court prior to the appeal to the Holy
See. In the absence of further documents bearing
on the case, it may be assumed that "the final overthrow
of the paramount claims of England, which
was one of the happy results of Bannockburn, of
course precluded any further English interference
with the agreement which had rescued the Priory
of May from an alien mother".<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The first extant document subsequent to the
severance of the connection between the Scottish
cell and the English monastery is dated the 1st of
July, 1318, and is a deed of gift by which William,
Bishop of St. Andrews, makes over to the Canons
of the Monastery of St. Andrews an annual pension
of sixteen merks formerly due by the Priory of
May to the Monastery of Reading.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
In 1415 there is an obligation by Henry, Bishop of St. Andrews,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
for payment to the same canons of twenty pounds
Scots out of the sequestrated revenues of the Priory
of May. About the middle of the century the
"Priory of Pittenweem or May" was annexed by
Pope Paul II to the See of St. Andrews, as a mensal
possession of the bishop's, during his lifetime. In
1472 this annexation was made perpetual by Pope
Sixtus IV.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">In this deed of annexation, and in others anterior
to it, from 1318 onwards, the alternative appellation
"May or Pittenweem" occurs. According to the
editor of the <cite>Records</cite>, the explanation seems to be
"that the Monks of May had, from the first, erected
an establishment of some sort on their manor of
Pittenweem, on the mainland of Fife, which, after
the priory was dissevered from the House of Reading
and annexed to that of St. Andrews, became
their chief seat, and that thereafter the monastery
on the island was deserted in favour of Pittenweem,
which was less exposed to the incursions of the English,
nearer to the superior house at St. Andrews,
and could be reached without the necessity of a precarious
passage by sea".<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">By a charter bearing the date of the 30th of
January, 1549, John Roull, Prior of Pittenweem,
feued the Isle of May to Patrick Learmonth of
Dairsy, Provost of St. Andrews. The deed of conveyance
describes the island as waste and spoiled by
rabbits, which had once been an important source of
revenue, but of which the warrens were now completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
destroyed. As reasons justifying the alienation
of the May, Roull referred to its remoteness
and to the consequent difficulty of access to it, to
its unprofitableness, and to its liability to invasion
by those ancient enemies, the English, who on the
outbreak of hostilities were wont to take possession
of it, thus rendering it a useless adjunct to his
monastery. Amongst the rights ceded to Learmonth
was that of patronage of the church, which
was to be maintained, and to which he was to
appoint a chaplain, for the purpose of continuing
divine service therein, out of reverence for the relics
and sepulchres of the saints interred in the island,
and for the reception of pilgrims and their offerings,
according to the custom of old times, and even
within memory of man.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Numerous records testify to the reverence in which
the island shrine of St. Adrian was held during the
fifteenth and the sixteenth century. Thus, it is
stated that when Mary of Gueldres was on her way
to Scotland in June, 1449, to become the wife of
James II, she anchored near the May, and performed
her devotions in the chapel before proceeding
on her voyage to Leith.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
It may be seen from entries in the Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer
for Scotland that King James IV was a very
assiduous pilgrim to the island, and a liberal patron
of the hermit who had established his cell there.
They record a visit which he paid in 1503. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
was not his first, as there is a brief notice of his
having landed in 1490; but it is the earliest of
which any details are supplied. He sailed from
Leith, accompanied by a considerable retinue,
amongst whom were the clerks of the Chapel Royal,
who sang mass in the chapel on the island. After
the celebration the Royal party took boat again, and,
safely piloted in "the litill bark callit the <em>Columb</em>"
by Robert Barton's mariners, who got fourteen shillings
for their trouble, landed at Anstruther. On
that occasion the hermit of May received nine shillings
by the King's command. In the beginning of July,
1505, John Merchamestoun was commissioned to
pass to Kinghorn, Dysart, and Kirkcaldy to seek
mariners against the King's passing to May. Previous
to the voyage, the King himself drew a hundred
French crowns for his own purse. The men that
rowed him to the ship received six shillings, and
next day, those "that rowit the King fra his schippes
to Maij, and to the schippes agane", got seven.
Nine shillings were paid "to the botemen that
brocht the Kingis stuf, and the maister cuke with
the Kingis souper fra the schip to Maij, and fra
Maij to the schip agane". The donation to the
hermit amounted to five shillings and fourpence.
Similar entries occur in 1506 and 1507; but those
of the former of these years show additional sums
for offerings of candles and of bread, and for a
donation on behalf of the Queen. They also show
that the royal ship was provided with nine cross-bows.
In 1508 there is evidence of a shooting party
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
on the May. On the last day of June in that year
sixteen pence were paid "to ane row bote that hed
the King about the Isle of Maij to schut at fowlis
with the culveryn". There were other three boats
"that hed in the Kingis folkis and chanounis, with
pairt of lardis of the contree". It was in the <em>Lion</em>
that James came over from the mainland; and
amongst the provisions with which she was supplied
for the voyage mention is made of one puncheon of
wine, three barrels of ale, and one hundred and four
score "breid of wheat". It is not unworthy of
notice that a charter, dated only a few days before
the death of James IV at Flodden, makes special
mention of the May.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
It erects certain lands into a free barony in favour of Sir Andrew Wood of
Largo on condition that he or his heirs should
accompany the King and his Consort, or their successors,
on their pilgrimages to the island.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="indent">An entry in the Register of the Privy Council
for the year 1577 not only bears out de Beaugu&eacute;'s
statement with regard to the presence of pirates
about the May, but it also suggests the complicity
of the people on the neighbouring coast. It sets
forth that "the Council has thought convenient that
the persons, buyers, and intromettors with the goods
taken in piracy by a French ship of war lately frequenting
about the May, shall be called before my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Lord Admiral and his deputies, as well to make
surety that the same shall be forthcoming to the just
owners, friends, and confederates of this realm, as
to underlie punishment for buying and resset of
unlawful gudis upon the stream, according to the
laws and justice".</p>

<p class="indent">A peculiar use to which the May was put in 1580
is recorded in the same Register. Certain persons
"infectit with the pest" having arrived within the
waters and river of Tay, on board a ship of which
John Anderson was master, charge had been given
them to withdraw themselves, together with their
ship and goods, with all possible diligence, to the Isle
of May, and to remain there, under pain of death,
till they were cleansed and had obtained licence to
depart. In spite of that, they had gone farther up
the Tay, with the intention of landing and selling
their goods. They were consequently ordered a
second time, under the same penalty, to be rigidly
executed, to repair to the Isle of May; and the
lieges were commanded, by open proclamation, at
all places needful, not to suffer any of them to
come to land or harbour, under the same penalty
of death. If any of the infected persons violated
the order, the Provost and Magistrates within whose
bounds the transgression had taken place were to
cause them and those who harboured them to be
apprehended and executed; the infected houses
were to be closed, and the ship, boats, and goods
to be burnt.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
The first lay proprietor of the May, Patrick Learmonth,
retained possession of the island for only
two years. In 1551, it was conferred on Andrew
Balfour of Monquhannie. Seven years later, it
was again granted to John Forret of Fyngask, with
the proviso that, in view of the exposed situation of
the isle, he should not be bound to pay the feu duty
at any time when there was war between Scotland
and any foreign nation. A still later owner of the
May was Allan Lamont, by whom it was sold to
Alexander Cunningham, Laird of Barnes. Cunningham
built on it "a convenient house, with accommodation
for a family". It was he, too, who, at
the request and for the benefit of the seafaring
population of the towns situated on the northern
coast of the firth, set up a lighthouse, the first on
the Scottish seaboard, on the Isle of May. The
Register of the Privy Council enables us to follow
some of the negotiations entered upon with a view
to its erection. In January, 1631, the Lords of the
Privy Council, in consequence of Cunningham's
application, ordered letters to be directed, charging
the Provosts and Bailies of Edinburgh, Dundee,
St. Andrews, Crail, Anstruther, Pittenweem, Dysart,
Kirkcaldy, Kinghorn, and Burntisland to send commissioners
to represent them before the Council,
and to give their advice and opinion "anent ane
propositioun made to the Kingis Majestie for erecting
of lichts upon the Isle of May, as ane thing
thought to be most necessarie and expedient for the
saulfetie of shippes arryving within the Firth". The
question of the costs which the upkeep of the light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
would entail appears to have presented considerable
difficulty at first. In spite of petitions from skippers
and others most directly interested in the scheme,
"the Lords of the Secret Council having heard and
considered the report made by the commissioners
for the burghs touching the lights craved by Alexander
Cunningham of Barnes to be erected on the
Isle of May, and being well advised therewith, and
with the reasons and grounds of the same", found
"no reason for imposing any duty to be uplifted
towards the maintenance of the said lights". The
matter was not, however, allowed to drop; and on
the 22nd of April, 1636, the King at length acceding
to the request of the coast towns, authorized
Cunningham to build a lighthouse and to keep it up
for nineteen years. Funds for its maintenance were
to be obtained directly from those most benefited
by it, by the imposition of a duty of two shillings
Scots&mdash;that is, two pence sterling&mdash;per ton, on all
ships sailing between St. Abb's Head and Dunottar.
Cunningham erected in the same year, "a tower
forty feet high, vaulted to the top and covered with
flagstones, whereon all the year over, there burned
in the night-time a fire of coals for a light". Sibbald
states that the coals employed were from Wemyss,
and that these were preferred on account of their
hardness and of the clearness of their light, that
about three hundred and eighty tons were consumed
annually, and that three men were employed in
keeping the beacon, two of whom were always on
watch during the night. In the edition of Sibbald's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
work published in 1803, it is mentioned that prior
to 1790, but subsequently to the time when the
dues had been fixed at three-halfpence per ton for
Scottish ships, and threepence for foreign&mdash;including
English&mdash;vessels, the revenue of the lighthouse was
farmed at &pound;280 per annum, that it then rose to
&pound;960, and that in 1800 it was further augmented
to &pound;1500&mdash;"a striking proof of the increase of trade
in this country". To commemorate the erection of
this earliest of the Northern Lights, and to indicate&mdash;not
absolutely correctly, however&mdash;the date, a
scholar of St. Andrews composed these two lines of
Latin doggerel:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Flumina ne noceant neu flumina lumina Maia</span>
<span class="i0">PrebVIt et MeDIIs InsVLa LVX et aqVIS.</span>
</div></div>

<p>There is a tradition that the architect who planned
and built the tower perished, on his voyage to the
mainland, in a storm which some old women, then
supposed to be witches, were burnt for raising.</p>

<p class="indent">In the description of the May contributed to the
<cite>Statistical Account of Scotland</cite> published in 1792,
the Rev. James Forrester reports a very melancholy
accident which happened whilst he was employed in
drawing up his notice, and which he thinks ought
to be recorded as a warning for future times. "The
keeper of the lighthouse, his wife, and five children
were suffocated. One child, an infant, is still alive,
who was found sucking at the breast of its dead
mother. Two men, who were assistants to the
keeper, were senseless, but got out alive. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
truly mournful event was owing to the cinders
having been allowed to accumulate for more than
ten years. The cinders reached up to the window
of the apartments where these unfortunate people
slept. They were set on fire by live coals falling
from the lighthouse, and the wind blowing the
smoke into the windows, and the door below being
shut, the consequences were inevitable. These persons
were the only inhabitants, and all of them
lodged in the lighthouse. The families who formerly
resided there lodged in houses detached from
it. The old plan is to be again adopted, and houses
are preparing for lodging the keeper and a boat's
crew, which will be of advantage to all the coast, as
they will be ready to give intelligence when the
herrings come into the Firth."</p>

<p class="indent">After the Union the unequal incidence of the
duties leviable for the light of May&mdash;English and
Irish vessels being charged double rates as foreigners&mdash;gave
rise to much dissatisfaction. In addition to
this, there was a general feeling that anything that
was payable in the form of a tax ought not to be
held as private property. With regard to the light
itself, it gradually became more evident that a coal
fire, exposed in an open choffer to the vicissitudes
of the weather, was altogether inadequate to the
requirements of the shipping trade. After the appointment
of a Lighthouse Board in Scotland in
the year 1786, those most directly affected often
expressed a wish that the light of May should be
included as one of the Northern Lights; that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
should get the benefit of the most recent improvements;
that, in accordance with the spirit and conditions
of the Act for the regulation of the Northern
Lighthouses, the invidious distinction between the
shipping of the three kingdoms should be done
away with; and, further, that there should be some
prospect of the duties being modified and ultimately
ceasing altogether. Moved by these various considerations,
the shipping trade of the Firth of Forth
repeatedly approached the family of Scotstarvit, into
whose hands the property and light of May had
come by purchase, in 1714, with a view to the improvement
of the old beacon. In consequence of
representations from the Chamber of Commerce of
Edinburgh, which visited the island in 1786, the
choffer was enlarged to the capacity of a square of
three feet, and the quantity of fuel annually consumed
increased to about 400 tons. The Chamber
further recommended that the stock of coals, hitherto
exposed to the open air on the island, should in
future be kept under cover, and that the supply
should invariably be obtained from the collieries of
Wemyss, of which the coal was considered fittest
for maintaining a steady light, and was consequently
employed at Heligoland and other coal lights on the
Continent. All these conditions were complied with
by Miss Scott of Scotstarvit's tutors, and from that
time the May beacon became the most powerful
coal light in the kingdom, the capacity of its choffer
being double that of any other. But even these
improvements could not prevent it from being unsteady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
in bad weather, and there still remained the
great disadvantage that limekilns and other accidental
open fires upon the neighbouring coast were apt to
be mistaken for the May light. To obviate the
possibility of such mistakes, the Trinity House of
Leith, in 1790, presented a memorial to the Duke
of Portland, who, through his marriage with Miss
Scott, had become proprietor of the May, and requested
him to replace the coal-beacon by an oil-light
with reflectors, enclosed in a glazed light-room.
In spite of this application and of many others
from various quarters, no further improvements
were introduced at the time.</p>

<p class="indent">In the year 1809, Robert Stevenson, engineer to
the Northern Lights Board, foreseeing that, notwithstanding
the recent erection of the Bell Rock
Lighthouse, the navigation of this part of the coast
would still be very dangerous unless the light of
May were improved, took an opportunity of bringing
the matter under the notice of the Commissioners,
who were not of opinion, however, that it
could be taken up by them except at the instance
of the proprietor. In the following year the question
was brought into prominence by an event of
serious importance. Early in the morning of the
19th of December two of His Majesty's ships, the
frigates <em>Nymphen</em> and <em>Pallas</em>, were wrecked near
Dunbar, in consequence, it was believed, of the fire
of a limekiln on the Haddingtonshire coast having
been mistaken for the May light. The ships were
completely lost, but, the weather being moderate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
only nine men were drowned out of the joint crews
of some 600. It was a remarkable circumstance attending
the catastrophe, that, although the two ships
had sailed in company, and had struck within a few
miles of each other, their similar fate was perfectly
unknown to the respective crews till late in the day.</p>

<p class="indent">This loss of &pound;100,000 roused the Government
to action. Lord Viscount Melville, who was First
Lord of the Admiralty at the time, applied to the
Lighthouse Board to take over the light of May
as one of the Northern Lights. In the negotiations
that ensued, the Duke of Portland proposed a
scheme, in accordance with which he was to carry
out the suggested alterations, and the Commissioners
were to become his lessees. This proposal did not,
however, meet with the approval of the latter, their
opinion being that the only position they could
assume in the transaction was that of purchasers for
the public. The ultimate result was the acquisition
of the Isle of May, together with the light duties,
for the sum of &pound;60,000&mdash;&pound;3000 less than the Duke
of Portland had originally demanded. This was in
1814. That same year an Act was passed reducing
the light duty to one penny per ton for all British
ships. Immediate measures were also taken for
carrying out the necessary improvements. In the
course of the following summer, a new lighthouse
was erected, and a light from oil, with reflectors,
was exhibited on the 1st of February, 1816. The
following official description of the new light of May
was published at the time:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
"The lighthouse on the Isle of May is situate at
the entrance of the Firth of Forth, in North lat.
56&deg; 12&acute;, and long. 2&deg; 36&acute; west of London. From
the lighthouse Fifeness bears by compass N. by E.
1/2 E., distant five miles; and the Staples Rocks,
lying off Dunbar, S. by W. 1/2 W., distant ten miles.
The light, being formerly from coal, exposed to
the weather in an open grate or choffer, was discontinued
on the night of the 1st of February, 1816,
when a light from oil, with reflectors, known to
mariners as a Stationary Light, was exhibited. The
new lighthouse tower upon the Isle of May is contiguous
to the side of the old one, and is elevated
240 feet above the medium level of the sea, of
which the masonry forms 57 feet, and is therefore
similar to the old tower in point of height. The
new light is defended from the weather in a glazed
light-room, and has a uniform steady appearance,
resembling a star of the first magnitude, and is seen
from all points of the compass, at the distance of
about 7 leagues, and intermediately, according to
the state of the atmosphere."</p>

<p class="indent">In the summer of 1814, shortly after the May
had been acquired by the Northern Lights Board,
Sir Walter Scott accompanied the Commissioners on
their visit of inspection. In the Diary which he
kept during the cruise, the following entry occurs
under date of the 29th of July, the day on which
the lighthouse yacht sailed from Leith:&mdash;"Reached
the Isle of May in the evening, went ashore, and
saw the light&mdash;an old tower, and much in the form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
of a border-keep, with a beacon-grate on the top.
It is to be abolished for an oil revolving-light, the
grate-fire only being ignited upon the leeward side
when the wind is very high.... The isle had once
a cell or two upon it. The vestiges of the chapel
are still visible. Mr. Stevenson proposed demolishing
the old tower, and I recommended 'ruining'
it '&agrave; la picturesque', i.e., demolishing it partially.
The island might make a delightful residence for
bathers."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Scott's romantic suggestion was not,
however, adopted. The old lighthouse tower on
the Isle of May was reduced in height to about
20 feet, and by direction of the Board was converted
into a guardroom for the convenience of pilots and
fishermen. The square, battlemented, white building
is still standing at the present day. Above
the door there is a tablet with a figure of the rising
sun over the date 1636. It is surmounted by a
lion holding an escutcheon, on which the armorial
bearings&mdash;probably those of the builder&mdash;are no
longer decipherable. In the vaulted room within
the tower there is an old iron grate with the initials
A. C., which suit Alexander Cunningham, and are
doubtless his.</p>

<p class="indent">The ruins mentioned by Sir Walter are also
visible at the present day, though in an even more
dilapidated state than when he saw them. They are
situated in a hollow, towards the south-east end of
the island, probably near the spot where the monastery
stood. They are doubtless the remains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
St. Adrian's Chapel, which continued to be visited
by pilgrims long after the destruction of the monastery
itself. The space within the walls measures
about 32 feet in length and 15 feet in breadth. In
the west wall are two windows, of which the semi-circular
interior openings seem to indicate Norman
work, and suggest the thirteenth century as the date
of the building. There are also remnants of windows
both in the south and in the north wall. A
shapeless gap near the southern extremity shows the
position of the door. Just within it there may still
be seen what is perhaps a fragment of the holy-water
stoup. From the fact that the ruins lie north
and south, it has been thought that the chapel occupied
only a part of the building, and duly lay east
and west within it. If such were the case, it must
have been of exceptionally small dimensions, and
have contained a very diminutive altar. At the
present time no attempt seems to be made to prevent
the venerable relic from falling further into
decay; and the rough enclosure within which it
stands is used as a sheep-pen.</p>

<p class="indent">The lighthouse now on the May is situated close
to the old tower. It is a massive quadrangular
stone building surmounted by a square tower which
at a distance gives it the appearance of a church. It
first came into use on the 1st of December, 1886.
For fifteen years previously the Commissioners of
the Northern Lights had been anxious to establish
an electric light on the Scottish coast; but it was
not till 1883 that the Board of Trade was able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
sanction the expenditure, and suggested its introduction
at the Isle of May, on the ground that
"there was no more important station on the
Scottish shores, whether considered as a landfall,
as a light for the guidance of the extensive or important
trade of the neighbouring coast, or as a
light to lead into the refuge of the Forth". The
new buildings, engines, electric machines and lamps
cost &pound;15,835; but, including old material which
it was found possible to utilize, the total installation
was estimated at &pound;22,435. As to technical details,
it may suffice to mention that the generators are two
of De Meritens's alternate-current magneto-electric
machines, weighing about four and a half tons each.
The engines are a pair of horizontal surface-condensing
steam engines, each with two cylinders
9 inches in diameter and 18 inches stroke, making
140 revolutions per minute. There are two steam
boilers, of which only one is in use at a time. Each
of them is 20 feet long and 5 feet 6 inches in diameter.
Only one of the three electric lamps is used
at a time, and is changed once an hour to allow it
to cool. The light is about 25,000 candle-power,
but when seen from the water gives a flash equal
to 3,000,000 candles, which can be increased to
6,000,000. The May apparatus is so designed as
to give a group of four flashes in quick succession,
followed by an interval of darkness lasting thirty
seconds. The highest recorded distance at which
the reflection of the light has been observed is
61 nautical miles. The May is also provided with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
a powerful horn, of which the sound serves as a
guide during the frequent "haars" or sea-fogs that
rise from the North Sea. In addition to this, it has
a smaller fixed light which serves as a leading light
for ships coming down from Fifeness. It is visible
on one side of the island only.</p>

<p class="indent">Owing to the increased cost of maintenance of the
May light&mdash;it is estimated at more than &pound;1000 a
year&mdash;an Order in Council was issued in 1886,
authorizing the collection of two-sixteenths of a
penny per ton, as light dues, from vessels carrying
cargo or passengers, which may pass or derive benefit
from the light when on a coasting or home-trade
voyage, and of one penny per ton when on an oversea
voyage, subject to the usual deductions.</p>

<p class="indent">The May light is served by seven keepers, the
chief of whom does not, however, share the watches.
Their quarters, which are neat and commodious, and
sufficiently large for the accommodation of such of
them as have families, are situated at some distance
from the lighthouse, between two hills that afford
protection from the prevalent gales. Close to them
is the engine-house, with its tall chimney-stalk.
The necessary supply of water for it is drawn from
the little lake, of which early descriptions of the
island make mention, and which has now been
turned into a reservoir.</p>

<h2>EDINBURGH AND HER PATRON SAINT</h2>

<p class="indent">Although Edinburgh does not appear to manifest
any consciousness of the fact, the 1st of September
is the feast of her patron saint. There was a time
when solemn celebrations marked the event. But
centuries have passed since then; and it would not
be very rash to assume that, at the present day, for
every thousand of its Presbyterian population, at
any rate, the city does not contain one man, woman,
or child who knows of any connection between St.
Giles and any special day in the year.</p>

<p class="indent">In this respect, it is true, Edinburgh is not more
indifferent than Glasgow. Every year the 13th of
January passes by without the slightest official recognition
on the part of the commercial metropolis.
In spite of that, however, St. Mungo and St. Giles
stand on a very different footing in their respective
cities. All Glaswegians know something of their
saint. Indeed, their municipal coat of arms makes it
impossible for them to be wholly ignorant of his
story. The very children amongst them are familiar
with the incidents which the bird, the tree, and the
ring commemorate; and reference to the capital
of the West as the city of St. Mungo is by no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
means uncommon. But whoever heard Edinburgh
call herself the city of St. Giles? Nor is this difference
in the esteem in which the two patrons are held
unnatural or unaccountable. For, whilst Glasgow's
tutelar saint was a true Scot, he under whose special
protection the capital chose to put itself was simply
an alien. Not but what he was a well-born and
eminently venerable person. We are told that St.
Giles, or, to give him his Latin name, Egidius, was
born in Greece in the seventh century. According
to the Roman Breviary, he was of royal lineage.
The same authority states that from his youth he
showed a great love for sacred learning and for
works of charity, and that, at the death of his
parents, he bestowed his whole inheritance on the
poor. The miracles which he was reported to have
wrought brought him a fame which was distasteful
to him. To escape from it he retired to Arles, in
France. He remained there but a short time, however,
having determined to lead the life of a hermit.
For this purpose he betook himself to a forest near
Gards, in the diocese of N&icirc;mes. There he lived
for a long time upon the roots and herbs and the
milk of a hind which came to him at regular hours&mdash;an
act of kindness for which the charitable and
faithful animal was not to go unrewarded, and to
which, indeed, she owes the honour of figuring in
the arms of the city of Edinburgh, of which she is
the sinister supporter. One day the hind was chased
by the King's hounds, and took refuge in Giles's
cave. "Thereby," says the Breviary, "the King of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
France was moved earnestly to entreat that Giles
would allow a monastery to be built in the place
where the cave was. Yielding to the pressing solicitations
of the King, he took the rule of this
monastery, although himself unwilling, and discharged
this duty in a wise and godly manner for
some years, until he passed away to heaven."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The biographical sketch supplied by the Breviary
suggests no connection between Giles and any part
of Britain&mdash;north or south; neither does there seem
to be anything extant to account for his being chosen
as the tutelar saint of Edinburgh. There are, however,
documents which prove that, as far back as the
thirteenth century, the parish church was dedicated
to him. Arnot states, on the authority of a charter
in the Advocates' Library, that, in the reign of
James II, Preston of Gortoun, having got possession
of a relic which was alleged to be an arm-bone
of St. Giles, bequeathed it to the mother kirk.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
In gratitude for this gift, the magistrates of the city
granted a charter in favour of the heirs of Preston,
entitling the nearest heir of the donor, being of the
name of Preston, to carry this sacred relic in all processions.
The magistrates, at the same time, obliged
themselves to found in this church an altar, and to
appoint a chaplain, for celebrating an annual mass
of requiem for the soul of the donor. They also
ordered that a tablet, displaying his arms and describing
his pious donation, should be put in the
chapel. The relic, enshrined in silver, was kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
amongst the treasures of the church till the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The outburst of iconoclasm which is chronicled
by John Knox as one of the marks of progress of
the Reformation in Scotland proved fatal to St.
Giles. "The images were stolen away in all parts
of the country," says the historian, "and in Edinburgh
was that great idol called St. Giles first
drowned in the North Loch, and after burned, which
raised no small trouble in the town." This was in
1557. But twelve months later there occurred
what may be looked upon as the public and formal
denial by Edinburgh of her patron saint, and his
violent and shameful deposition by his whilom devotees.
This "tragedy of St. Giles" is recorded by
Knox with that grim humour which is characteristic
of him. He relates that, on the approach of St.
Giles's day, the bishops gave charge to the Provost,
Bailies, and Council of Edinburgh, either to get the
old St. Giles again, or else to provide a new image
at their expense. To this the Council answered, in
words that breathe the very spirit of the reformer
himself, "That to them the charge appeared very
unjust. They understood that God, in some places,
had commanded idols and images to be destroyed, but
where He had commanded images to be set up, they
had not read; and they desired the Archbishop of St.
Andrews to find a warrant for his commandment."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
In spite of this refusal, the priests and friars
determined to have "that great solemnity and
manifest abomination which they accustomably had
upon St. Giles's day", or, in other words, to hold
the annual procession. To replace the statue that
had come to grief the year before, "a marmoset
idol" was borrowed from the Grey Friars; who, as
security for its safe return, required the deposit of
"a silver piece". It was made fast with iron nails
to a feretory, or portable shrine. "There assembled
priests, friars, canons, and rotten Papists, with tabours
and trumpets, banners and bagpipes. And who was
there to lead the ring but the Queen Regent herself,
with all her shavelings, for honour of that feast?"
For all her unpopularity, Mary exercised a restraining
influence on the mob. But that day she was
to dine "in Sandie Carpetyne's house, betwixt the
Bows"&mdash;that is to say, between the West Bow and
the Nether Bow; and so when, after going down
the High Street and as far as the foot of the Canongate,
"the idol returned back again, she left it and
passed in to her dinner".</p>

<p class="indent">The Regent's withdrawal from the procession was
the signal for the outbreak of the riot which Knox
dignifies with the title of "the enterprise". They
that were of it at once approached to the statue, and
pretended they were anxious to help in bearing it.
Having got the feretory upon their shoulders, they
began to shake it roughly, thinking that this would
bring down the "idol". But the iron nails resisted
such slight efforts, and, casting aside all pretence,
they pulled it down violently to the cry of "Down
with the idol! down with it!" "Some brag made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the priests' patrons at the first," records Knox; "but
they soon saw the feebleness of their god, for one
took him by the heels, and dadding his head to the
causeway, left Dagon without head or hands, and
said, 'Fie upon thee, thou young St. Giles, thy
father would have tarried for such!' This considered,
the priests and friars fled faster than they
did at Pinkie Cleuch! Down go the crosses, off go
the surplices, and the round caps corner with the
crowns. The Grey Friars gaped, the Black Friars
blew, the priests panted and fled, and happy was he
that first go into the house; for such a sudden fray
came never among the generation of Antichrist within
this realm before."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">These riotous proceedings chanced to be witnessed
by a "merry Englishman", who, seeing that there
was more noise and confusion than hurt or injury,
and that the discomfiture was bloodless, thought he
would add some merriment to the matter. And the
gibes in which he indulged so tickled Knox's sense
of humour that he duly records them: "Fie upon
you, why have ye broken order? Down the street
ye passed in great array and with great mirth. Why
fly ye, villains, now without order? Turn and strike
every man a stroke, for the honour of his god! Fie,
cowards, fie, ye shall never be judged worthy of your
wages again!" "But," adds the chronicler, "exhortations
were then unprofitable; for after Baal had
broken his neck there was no comfort to his confused army."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
From that memorable fall of his, on September 1,
1558, St. Giles has never recovered. His name,
indeed, is not wholly forgotten, and cannot be, so
long as Edinburgh's venerable cathedral bears it;
but if he be in honour anywhere, it is not in the
city which once chose him for its patron, even in
preference to any in the respectable company of
home-bred saints that lay ready at hand in the
calendar.</p>

<h2>THE ROCK OF DUMBARTON</h2>
<h3>Some Incidents in its History</h3>

<p class="indent">The Castle of Dumbarton is one of the Scottish
fortresses for the maintenance of which special provision
was made in the Treaty of Union. In its
case, however, little more than the mere letter of
the law has been observed. For years past its sole
garrison has consisted of a caretaker; and, in so far
as any practical purpose is concerned, it has ceased
to be a stronghold at all. But, though no longer
possessing any military importance, the old "Fort
of the Britons" is still interesting and noteworthy
for the part that it played, through so many centuries,
in the national history.</p>

<p class="indent">There is no evidence to prove that the wall built
across the country by the Roman invaders extended
quite as far as Dumbarton. It cannot be supposed,
however, that they ignored the strategic importance
of the Rock, and failed to occupy a position which
was practically the key to the West of Scotland. As
to the existence of a fort during the period that
followed the evacuation of Britain by the Romans,
there can be no doubt. The Welsh chronicles refer
to it under the name of Alclud, or Alcluid, that is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
"the Rock of the Clyde". Further, it is recorded
in the <cite>Historia Britonum</cite> "that, as the result
of a battle fought between the Britons and the sons of
Ida, in 573, the greater part of the North Country
fell into the hands of a king called Ryderchen, who
chose as his seat the stronghold known to the Gaels
by the name of Dunbraton," or the fort of the
Britons&mdash;the original form of the modern Dumbarton.
In confirmation of this sixth-century occupation
of the Rock, there is a passage in the life of
Columba where Adamnan states that the saint was
consulted by King Rodorcus, son of Totail, who
reigned on the Rock of the Clyde.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
Under the date of 870, the <cite>Annals of Ulster</cite> and other Irish chronicles
record that the Norse leaders Amlaiph and Imhar
laid siege to Strathclyde, in Britain. Besides cutting
off all provisions, they were able to draw off, "in
a wonderful manner", the water of the well within
the fortress. By reducing the defenders to such a
state of weakness that they could not repulse their
assailants, hunger and thirst gave the Norsemen
possession of the fortress.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">At the time of the dispute between Bruce and
Baliol, the Castle of Dumbarton was in the keeping
of Nicholas de Segrave. By virtue of the right that
he claimed as feudal superior, Edward I commanded
the fortress to be handed over to the competitor in
whose favour he had pronounced. It was not till
1296, however, that the English King was able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
enforce his order, and to appoint a Governor of his
own choosing. This was Alexander de Ledes, whom
he also made Sheriff of the County. De Ledes was
succeeded by Sir John Menteith, who earned an
unenviable notoriety by the betrayal and capture
of Wallace, and to whose keeping the illustrious
prisoner was entrusted prior to his being removed
to London. The Scottish hero's sword was long
preserved as an historical relic in the Castle. An
entry in the Accounts of the Lord Treasurer shows
that it was there at the time of James IV's visit,
in 1505, and that the King paid for "binding of
Wallass sword with cordis of silk, and new hilt, and
plomet, new skabbard, and new belt to the said
sword".<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
 It was not till 1888 that this interesting
memorial of the patriot was transferred to Stirling.</p>

<p class="indent">On the doubtful authority of a passage to be
found in some of the manuscript versions of Bower's
continuation of Fordun, Dumbarton is made the
scene of one of Bruce's many narrow escapes from
falling into the hands of his enemies. The account
given is to the effect that the Scottish King, wishing
to obtain possession of the Castle, entered into negotiations
with Menteith, by whom it was still held
for the English, and that the treacherous Governor,
on the understanding that he should receive the
Earldom of Lennox as his reward, consented to
deliver the fortress. As Bruce, with a number of
followers, was on his way to enter into possession,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
in accordance with the agreement, he was met by a
carpenter whom Bower calls Roland, who warned
him that Menteith meant to capture or kill him.
Being thus forewarned, the King was able to turn
the tables on his intending captor, who was himself
confined in the Castle till shortly before Bannockburn,
when he was released on condition that he
should fight against the English.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Another romantic episode, to which no date can
be assigned, is related by Sir William Fraser, on the
authority of "tradition". The sovereign that occupied
the throne of Scotland at the time, he says, had
lost Dumbarton Castle, and was anxious to recover
it. Having applied to one of the Colquhouns for
assistance, the answer he got from the Laird of Luss
was, "If I can". "Colquhoun let a stag loose on
the level ground within sight of the Castle, and got
up a mock hunt after it, with great blowing of
horns, and other noises, to attract the attention of
the garrison, hoping that they might be induced to
join in the sport and leave the fortress undefended.
Everything happened as Colquhoun had wished.
Nearly the whole of the garrison went forth to
take part in the pastime. During their absence,
Colquhoun and the men that he had selected hastened
into the Castle, overpowered the feeble remainder
of its defenders, and made themselves its
masters."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
This incident of "early times" may possibly
be authentic; but it looks rather suspiciously
like an ingenious attempt to find a plausible and
picturesque origin for the Colquhoun motto, "Si je puis".</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
At the beginning of the fifteenth century, the
Castle of Dumbarton was made to serve a very
singular purpose. In circumstances of which no
explanation is given, an individual whom Wyntoun
describes as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mastere Waltere off Danyelstoune,</span>

</div></div>

<p>took possession of the fortress, and, as Fordun adds,
held it "with a large military force, to the great
annoyance of the King and the kingdom". The
Government being unable to drive him out, was
obliged to accept the condition on which he offered
to surrender his capture. It was nothing less than
his appointment to the See of St. Andrews; and he
had his way, being elected Bishop in 1402. He did
not, however, long enjoy the dignity with which he
had got himself clothed,</p>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">The latter years of the same century witnessed
one of the most important events in the history
of Dumbarton Castle. In 1488, it was entrusted to
the keeping of the Earl of Lennox and his eldest
son, Matthew Stuart, who, in the course of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
following year, engaged, with Lord Lyle and others,
in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the Government,
and fortified the stronghold accordingly.
Repeated summons to surrender having been disregarded,
messengers were dispatched through the
whole county to convoke the militia; and it was
arranged that, whilst James proceeded in person to
Crookston and Duchal, Colin, first Earl of Argyle,
should lay siege to Dumbarton Castle; and elaborate
preparation was made for the transport of the most
powerful artillery of the day, including the famous
Mons Meg, into the rebellious West. The smaller
strongholds were soon reduced, but the Rock held
out, and the defenders, making a vigorous sally,
dislodged their assailants by burning the town, and
so raised the siege. The Royal forces, on being
thus driven off, fell back upon Dunglas, where new
materials were quickly collected, another great gun,
"callit Duchal", being brought from Arkil, near
Paisley, the boats conveyed overland from Daldres&mdash;the
present Grangemouth&mdash;and from Blackness.
With all this, it was not till the second week in
December, fully seven months after the commencement
of operations, that the stronghold was obliged
to surrender. A formal sentence of forfeiture and
death was passed on Lennox and his son, but annulled
on their appeal by reason of some technical
flaw.</p>

<p class="indent">Passing over the lesser siege of 1513-14, the
occupation of 1543 in the interest of Henry VIII,
the departure of the child-queen Mary, in 1548,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
and other events of slighter importance, we come
to the most sensational episode of all. It was after
Langside. Lord Fleming had returned from accompanying
Queen Mary to England, and had resumed
his governorship of the fortress which he held for
her. The Regent Murray was desirous of obtaining
possession of so important a position, and, negotiations
having failed, went down in person to open
the siege. So strict was the blockade that Fleming
was on the point of surrendering when the assassination
of Murray brought him some respite. Lennox,
who succeeded as Regent, was equally bent on the
capture of the Castle, and endeavoured to obtain
help from England. But Elizabeth was opposed
to hostile measures, and sent Drury to reopen
negotiations with Lord Fleming and John Hamilton,
Bishop of St. Andrews, who was with him. The
mission nearly proved fatal to the English ambassador.
He was enticed within gunshot and deliberately,
though unsuccessfully, fired upon.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
This dastardly attempt is the subject of a contemporary
poem entitled <cite>The Tressoun of Dunbartane</cite>.</p>

<p class="indent">The siege continued to drag on slowly, when
about the end of March, 1571, a man named
Robertson, who had formerly belonged to the garrison,
but who wished to be revenged for some
punishment inflicted on his wife, suggested a plan
for taking the Castle by surprise. It was adopted,
and Captain Thomas Crawfurd of Jordanhill was
entrusted with the desperate enterprise. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
evening of the 31st, Crawfurd sent forward some
horsemen to intercept all communication with Dumbarton,
he himself following about midnight with
a body of resolute men. After a short halt at
Dumbuck, the party, provided with ropes and
ladders, proceeded to the foot of the Rock, which
was to be scaled at the "Beik", for although this was
the highest point, it offered the advantage of being
unguarded, by reason of its supposed inaccessibility.
At the first attempt the ladder slipped back with
the weight of the climbers. On the second it was
found that it did not reach within twenty feet
of a tree to which it was intended to make it
fast. The difficulty was overcome by Crawfurd,
who, crawling up to the tree, threw a rope around
it, and thus enabled his party to reach this first
stage. The operation was being repeated for a
further ascent when an accident nearly brought
disaster on the whole undertaking. One of the
men fell into a kind of fit whilst on the ladder, and
remained clinging desperately to the rungs and
blocking the way. But, even for this, Crawfurd's
readiness devised a remedy. Lashing the man to
the ladder, he turned it round, so that the remainder
of the party could mount over their comrade's upturned
body. Owing to the delay caused by these
untoward occurrences, it was nearly daylight when
the first of the assailants reached the top. They
were seen by the sentries through the fog, which
had so far favoured them, and the alarm was given.
The resistance offered was, however, but feeble.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Three men of the garrison were killed. Many of
the others, including Fleming himself, succeeded in
escaping. Amongst those that were taken prisoners
was the Bishop of St. Andrews. He was subsequently
hanged for complicity in the murders of
Darnley and of Murray.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Another noteworthy capture of Dumbarton Castle
occurred in 1639. At that time the fortress was
held for the king by Sir William Stewart. On the
last Sunday in March, having gone to the Communion
service in Dumbarton, he was invited to
dinner by Provost Sempill, a zealous Covenanter.
To his refusal Sempill replied, "I require you to
go with me." Thereupon the Governor and his
party were surrounded by forty armed men and
hurried off to the Provost's house, where, under
threats of death, Stewart was obliged to send for
the keys and to hand them over to his captor. The
sequel is told by Spalding. "Stewart," he says,
"was compelled to cast off his clothes, which were
shortly put upon another gentleman of his shape
and quantity, and he put on his clothes upon him
again. Thus, apparel interchanged, they commanded
the Captain, under pain of death, to tell the watchword,
which, for fear of his life, he truly told.
Then they go in the night quietly, unseen by the
Castilians, and had this counterfeit captain with
them, who cried and called by the watchword, which
heard, yetts are cast open, in go these Covenanters
with greater power than was within to defend it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>

same to their mind."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The further vicissitudes of Dumbarton Castle&mdash;its
alternate occupation by Royalists and Parliamentarians
during the Civil War, its use at various
periods as a place of confinement for such different
prisoners as Ogilvie the Jesuit, Carstairs and his
fellow Covenanters, the Marquis of Tullibardine
and other Jacobites&mdash;would require to be recorded
in detail in a more complete sketch of the history
of the Rock. They may be passed over without
further mention in what lays no claim to do more
than to recall some of the leading incidents in its
chequered story.</p>

<h2>JAMES VI&emsp;AS STATESMAN AND POET</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;AS STATESMAN</h3>

<p class="indent">Those who accept the traditional estimate of James
VI's character may deem it little short of preposterous
to connect his name with the idea of statesmanship.
To them he appears as a garrulous
pedant and a coarse buffoon, whose rickety walk
was the outward sign of a feeble, vacillating temper;
as a would-be autocrat who, whilst constantly obtruding
his despotic theories on his subjects, lacked
the strength of mind and the energy to put them
into practice; and, to express it briefly and bluntly
in the words of Macaulay, as "a drivelling idiot"
and "a finished specimen of all that a king ought
not to be".<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
But there is another portrait that may
be drawn of him. Materials for it will be found
not in the rhetorical descriptions of writers whose
aim was literary effect or political denunciation, but
in those absolutely trustworthy, if most prosaic
and unimaginative documents, the Acts of the Privy
Council. And it was Professor Masson, the editor
of those records, who asserted that it is impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
for anyone duly acquainted with them "to think of
James as other than a man of a very remarkable
measure of political ability and inventiveness, with
a tenacity and pertinacity of purpose that could show
itself in a savage glitter of the eye whenever he was
offended or thwarted, and in a merciless rigour in
hunting down and crushing his ascertained opponents".<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
It is worth going to the same sources
of information for the purpose of determining to
what extent this view is justified.</p>

<p class="indent">In any attempt at a survey of the administration
of James VI it is important to remember that, although
he became nominal sovereign at an early
age, it was not until he had reached his thirtieth
year that he got the reins of government fully into
his own hands. That occurred towards the close of
1595, at the death of Lord Maitland of Thirlstane,
after a Chancellorship and Premiership of over eight
years. It was then that on being asked how he
intended to fill up the vacant office, James replied
that he was resolved no more to use great men as
Chancellors in his affairs, but only such as he could
correct and were hangable.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The peculiar idea of kingship or sovereign
authority which the enfranchised monarch thus expressed,
and which he took every opportunity of
repeating in both his speeches and his writings, is
the more noteworthy that it was opposed to the
principles which must have been inculcated upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
him in his early years. For it must be remembered
that his tutor, Buchanan, was a politician as well
as a scholar, and that it was he who wrote the
famous treatise, <cite>De Jure Regni apud Scotos</cite>, that
vigorous exposition of liberal and constitutional
monarchy which justifies the description of its author
as "the first Whig". It is certainly not to him
that James's training in autocracy is to be attributed,
but rather to Thirlstane. That statesman, it is true,
ruled the Court and the country for years with a
fixity of purpose and a firmness of hand that bore
down opposition, and did not allow the King himself
any opportunity of asserting his independence.
At the same time, however, he did not fail to urge
upon him the necessity for dealing energetically with
the abuses which had arisen owing to the turbulent
insolence and the intolerable oppression of the
arrogant nobility. James had not been deaf to
advice so conformable with his character and disposition.
He had taken it so thoroughly to heart
that, although he could not shake himself free from
his Minister's despotism, it had become irksome
and galling to him. When Maitland lay on his
deathbed his Sovereign refused repeated requests
to visit him, and it was even said that he had
whispered in a courtier's ear that "it would be
a small matter if the Chancellor were hanged".<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
The years that intervened between Maitland's death
and James's departure from Scotland at length gave
the King his opportunity, and not only did he at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
once show his determination of becoming master
within his own kingdom, but he also succeeded in
actually carrying it out to a very noteworthy degree.
And of the qualifications that enabled him to do
so none was more conspicuously displayed than his
ability to extract power to shape things according
to his mind from the very incidents that the opposition
to his royal will and pleasure evoked. An
instance of this was afforded by his energetic conduct
when the Edinburgh riot of December, 1596,
originating in a demonstration in favour of the
rights of Presbytery, as championed by Mr. David
Black, of St. Andrews, gave him a chance of striking
at the antagonists to his notion of supremacy. And
the same inflexibility of purpose and dexterous
management of circumstances appeared, four years
later, in the use which he made of the Gowrie
tragedy as an instrument for the subjection of the
Scottish clergy. The monarch who could turn such
occurrences as those to political profit had some
right to boast of his "kingcraft". We may not
approve of the system which he followed of marking
out individual opponents and of striking them down
with a strong and merciless hand, but we must
admit that it proved effectual, and acknowledge that
the man whose conduct of the bitter struggle it
characterized cannot be contemptuously dismissed
as "a nervous, drivelling idiot".</p>

<p class="indent">One of the special points with regard to which
James has a claim to recognition is the zeal with
which he undertook and consistently performed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
task of checking the lawlessness and rebellion that
had been rampant in Scotland during his minority.
The Royal Declaration in which he announced his
intention of bestowing his "haill travellis, moyane,
and diligens" on the work of reform was not
allowed to remain a dead letter. Page after page
of the records testify to the resoluteness with which
he enforced the laws which had for their object the
restoration of order throughout the kingdom, and
which were directed more particularly against two
classes of offenders&mdash;the "horners" and the members
of families at hereditary feud. Horners, as
they were called in Scotland, were all persons who
stood out in denounced disobedience to the decrees
of any law court, for any kind of offence from
simple debt to murder and treason. At one time
the country was full of such. Mere proclamations
against them having proved of little avail, James at
length had recourse to a measure which proved
more effectual. He established a flying police, consisting
of a body of forty well-equipped horsemen,
"to be in reddiness at all occasiounis to hunt, follow
and perseu all and quhatsumevir rebellis within this
countrie, without respect of persones, quhither thair
rebellioun be for civill or criminall caussis, and to
tak thair houssis and uplift thair eschaitis as thai
salbe directit and commandit".<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
The beneficial result of these stringent disciplinary measures was
soonest and most distinctly apparent in the Borders,
or, as James desired them to be called after his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
accession to the English throne, "the Midland
Shires of Britain", which, within the space of four
or five years, were so thoroughly subdued that they
ceased to be a sanctuary for rough-riding reivers,
and entered upon that more peaceful era of their
existence which has now lasted for three hundred years.</p>

<p class="indent">In an Act "anent deidly feidis", evidently emanating
from James himself, the Council reminded
the lieges that "The Kingis most gratious Majestie,
ever since his first cuming to yeiris of perfectioun",
had displayed "ain maist ernest and ardent zaill
and desyer to have removit frome amange his
subjectis of the cuntrey of Scotland all sic custumis,
faschiounnis, and behaviouris as did in ony weyis
smell of barbarity and sevegnes", and had been
unremitting in his endeavours to suppress the
"barbarous and detestable consuetud of deidly
feids".<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
Nothing could be better founded than the
claim thus put forward on the King's behalf, for
one of the most commendable features in his administration
is to be found in the perseverance with
which he strove to put an end to this characteristically
Scottish form of disorder by means both of
preventive and punitive legislation. He did not
succeed in wholly rooting out the "weid of deidly
feid", but there is abundant evidence to prove that,
thanks to vigilant care and vigorous action, he was
able to check its baneful growth.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
In taking the measure of James VI as a statesman,
it is important not to overlook the method
which he adopted to carry on the government of
Scotland as an absentee king. It is assuredly no
sign of weakness or incapacity that the nearest approach
to that absolutism that he had set up as his
ideal was made by him after his departure to take
possession of the crown left him by Elizabeth.
What he achieved in this respect was once set forth
by him in a speech to his refractory English Parliament.
"This I must say for Scotland, and may
truly vaunt it: here I sit and govern it with my
pen; I write and it is done; and by a Clerk of the
Council I govern Scotland now&mdash;which others could
not do by the sword."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
That such was literally the case, that he kept himself fully acquainted with
everything that went on in his northern kingdom,
and that the measures adopted by his Ministers for
its control and management were nothing but the
embodiment of his Royal will, is established beyond
dispute by the letters which he periodically sent to
Edinburgh from his palace in the capital or one of
his hunting seats in the shires.</p>

<p class="indent">Even the most hostile of James VI's critics give
him credit for having endeavoured to promote one
excellent measure&mdash;the union of England and
Scotland. To what negotiations the scheme gave
rise, how it was discussed in both Parliaments,
what eloquent testimony Sir Francis Bacon bore
to the statesmanlike character of the King's views
and intentions, and in what circumstances the projected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
treaty broke down under the weight of
English prejudice and jealousy&mdash;those are the details
of a story which cannot be told now. It must
suffice to recall that, if James had had his way,
history would have been anticipated by a whole
century.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;AS POET</h3>

<p class="indent">The "bagage litt&eacute;raire" of James VI is but slight,
and if the profound indifference of all and the absolute
ignorance of most as to its very existence be
taken as representing a fair estimate of its merit it
must in truth be worthless. But if, on the other
hand, we consult his contemporaries we must, unless
we are prepared to dismiss them all as more shamelessly
fulsome in their adulation than the average of
courtly flatterers, at least recognize the possibility
of his having been a little better than posterity has
been taught to believe. Long before James VI
became James I his reputation as a poet had reached
England, and helped to swell the chorus of welcome
that greeted him on his arrival. In 1598 Barnfield
made the King's love of poetry the point of one of
his sonnets:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And you, that discommend sweet Poesie,</span>

<span class="i0">The King of Scots&mdash;now living&mdash;is a poet,</span>
<span class="i0">As his "Lepanto" and his "Furies" show it.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Before this, Harvey in his <cite>Pierce's Supererogation</cite>,
had already proclaimed the poetical merit of
"Lepanto", declaring it, in his high-flown style, to
be "a short, but heroicall worke, in meeter, but
royall meeter, fitt for a David's harpe".<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
Two years later the judgment of Vaughan was that
"James is a notable Poet, and daily setteth out
most learned poems, to the admiration of all his
subjects".<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
In 1600 Allott gave ten quotations from
James in his <cite>England's Parnassus</cite>, and Bodenham
claims that in "The Garden of the Muses", from
"what workes of Poetrie have been put to the
world's eye by that learned and right royall King
and Poet, James King of Scotland, no one sentence
of worth has escaped".<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
After the accession to the English throne, Jonson addressed "To King James"
an epigram of ten lines, in which he expanded the idea
of the monarch's excellence as both prince and poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How, best of kings, dost thou a scepter bear?</span>
<span class="i0">How, best of poets, dost thou the laurel wear?</span>

<span class="i0">And gave thee both, to show they could no more.</span>
<span class="i0">For such a poet, while thy days were green,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou wert, as chief of them are said t'have been.</span>
<span class="i0">And such a prince thou art, we daily see,</span>
<span class="i0">As chief of those still promise they will be.</span>
<span class="i0">Whom should my Muse then fly to, but the best</span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
And Sir John Beaumont, in a carefully polished
poem written before, but published after James's
death, and entitled "To His late Maiesty, concerning
the True Forme of English Poetry", bestowed
upon him the more subtle flattery of calling him
the Master whose "judicious rules" have been his
guide.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
Here the reference is to James, not only
as a poet but as a critic also. For one of his early
prose treatises was entitled <cite>Reulis and Cautelis to be
Observit and Eschewit in Scottis Poesie</cite>. This was
the manifesto of a group of poets, amongst whom
were, in addition to the King himself, Alexander
Montgomerie, the author of <cite>The Cherry and the Slae</cite>;
Fowler, and the Hudsons, and whose aim was to
found a school of Scottish poetry. This document
contained a passage which is interesting enough to
be quoted. Setting forth the "twa caussis" that
have induced him to compose his treatise, the Royal
lawgiver of Parnassus says: "The ane is; as for
thame that wrait of auld, lyke as the tyme is
changeit sinsyne, so is the ordour of poesie changeit.
The other cause is; that as for thame that has
written in it of late, there has never ane of thame
written in our (Scottis) languag. For albeit sindrie
hes written of it in English, quhilk is lykest to our
language, zit we differ from thame in sindrie reulis
of poesie, as ze will find be experience."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
And we believe there are Scotsmen who will account it to
James for righteousness that he at least made an
attempt, abortive though it proved, to maintain
Scotland's autonomy in language and in poetry.</p>

In forming an estimate of the King's poetical productions,
it is but fair to bear in mind that "all of his
poems, save three or four sonnets and the revisions
of his early paraphrases of the Psalms, belong to
the period of his reign in Scotland", and that "the
greater portion of them were composed either before
the publication of the first volume of his poems in
his nineteenth year or in the time of romantic enthusiasm
excited by his marriage".<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
We have "The First Verses that ever the King Made". They are
written in a sententious vein which might be looked
upon as characteristic of the author, were it not that
this special feature "is one of the commonest in
Scottish poetry of the Chaucerian tradition". And
if, on the one hand, it cannot be claimed for them
that they bear evidence of exceptional talent, on the
other it must be admitted that, as the production of
a lad of fifteen, they were quite creditable:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">James was still, as he puts it himself, in his "verie
young and tender yeares: wherein nature (except
shee were a monster) can admit no perfection",
when he wrote his "Lepanto", which his contemporaries
seem to have looked upon as the best of
his poems, and to which Du Bartas paid the compliment
of translating it into French. It is no
masterpiece, but Mr. Westcott, the editor of the
<cite>New Poems by James I of England</cite>, does not exaggerate
the author's merit when he says that "his style
in the description of the battle between the Christian
and the Turkish navies is concrete and lively, and
at times achieves an almost ballad-like simplicity".
This seems to us to be justified by such lines as
those which describe the gathering of the Christian
forces:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">James did not make frequent use of this metre,
but he adopted it for another poem of a very different
kind, "A Dreame on his Mistris my Ladie Glammes",
in which he displays some ingenuity and inventive
skill. Interpreting one of the tokens that have been
left him&mdash;an amethyst&mdash;he says:</p>

There are 268 lines altogether, and the discovery
of them ought to contribute in some degree to the
poetical rehabilitation of the author.</p>

<p class="indent">As a knowledge of James's character would suggest,
his interest in the art of poetry was mainly
directed to the details of verse making and diction,
and it seems natural in such a stickler for metrical
propriety that in his shorter poems his favourite
form should have been the sonnet. His highest
achievement in this department has always been
considered to be the sonnet to his son Henry, at
the beginning of the <cite>Basilicon Doron</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="indent">Of this poem Bishop Percy said that it would not
dishonour any writer of that time, and a later critic
has pronounced that it is by far James's best performance,
"which just misses being really fine".
By the side of it there may now be placed, by
reason of their "sustained music, conformity to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
technique of the sonnet, and prettiness of fancy, if
not elevation", at least three others which figure
amongst the twenty-six hitherto unpublished poems
included in the manuscript which Mr. Westcott has
discovered. One of them refers to a lady, probably
the daughter of Sir John Wemyss, whose name was
Cicely:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">On the strength of this, or of anything we have
quoted from James's poems, it would be supremely
unreasonable to claim for him a place on the same
level as that of the authors either of "The King's
Quhair" or of "The Gaberlunzie Man". But it
may be less unjustifiable to suggest that he is not
absolutely undeserving of a corner in anthologies of
the Scottish poems of the sixteenth and of the early
seventeenth century. That he is altogether contemptible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
is an opinion that might be maintained
if we had nothing better of his than the string of

<h2>THE INVASION OF AILSA CRAIG</h2>

<p class="indent">Although in the possession of the historic family
of Kennedy, to the head of which it gives his title,
Ailsa Craig, the imposing "ocean pyramid" that
rises in solitary grandeur to a height of over 1100
feet above the waters of the Firth of Clyde, does
not figure prominently in the annals of the country,
nor in the special records of the district to which
it belongs. Its whole story consists of a single
episode, which, though hardly noticed by modern
historians, created some excitement, both in Scotland
and in England, at the time of its occurrence,
and may be read with interest at the present day.
That incident, the invasion of Ailsa Craig, which
it is here intended to relate on the authority of
contemporary documents, takes us back to the year
1597. The chief actors in it were Hugh Barclay,
Laird of Ladylands, an Ayrshire gentleman of good
family, whose estate was situated in the neighbourhood
of Irvine, and Andrew Knox, "minister of
God's worde at Paselye".</p>

<p class="indent">Though originally a member of the Presbyterian
Church, Ladylands had made "defectioun and apostacie
fra the said trewe religioun". In the correspondence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
of the time he is usually to be found
figuring in the lists of those whom it was customary
to describe as "practising Papists", a designation
not undeserved in his case, for amongst the religious
enthusiasts who devoted themselves to the restoration
of the old religion none displayed a greater
fixity of purpose, a more unscrupulous contempt for
the law, or a more reckless disregard of personal
danger. Andrew Knox, on the other hand, in spite
of his peaceful calling, gave proof of equal determination
and equal audacity in the fulfilment of the
self-imposed mission of hunting down "Jesuitis,
seminarie preistis, and suspect trafficquaris with the
King of Spain, and utheris foreynaris". The plotting
of the laird and the counter-plotting of the
minister had more than once brought the two men
into personal conflict. Indeed, so far as extant
documents go, the career of the one is practically
identified with the career of the other.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1592, which seems to be the year in which he
abandoned Presbyterianism, Ladylands was "excommunicated
for Papistrye", but granted "a licence to
departe out of the realme". Before his departure,
however, it was discovered that he and "twoe Inglishmen
of the worst sorte haunted togither" at
Irvine and other places in the west.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
In consequence of this, it was at once resolved to take him
and his accomplices "quietlie", and to bring them
back to Edinburgh. The difficult task of apprehending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
him was undertaken by Andrew Knox, and
successfully carried out, though at "no little paines
and perill". He pursued the conspirators through
Glasgow and towards Irvine, and pressed them so
closely that Ladylands was driven to the necessity
of giving himself up to James Hamilton, the eldest
son of Lord Claude, though not till, by some means
which are unfortunately not recorded, he had provided
for the safety of his confederates. Under the
charge of Andrew Knox and Captain Hamilton he
was led back to Edinburgh, and handed over to the
Provost's keeping. On being examined he "confessed
himselfe excommunicated and to be of the
Catholique Romaine Church and not of the Church
established in Scotlande, and he agreed to answer to
any interrogatorye charginge him in cryme of treason
wherein he pleaded his inocencye, but he derectlie
refused to answere to anye question touchinge matter
of religion, or as micht accuse or charge anye person
other than himselfe onlye".</p>

<p class="indent">The object of the conspiracy in which Ladylands
had been engaged soon became apparent. Towards
the end of December, George Ker, brother to Mark
Lord Newbottle, came down to Fairlie, intending to
set sail from the "West Sea Bank". His presence
in the neighbourhood and his frequent visits to the
Island of Cumbrae having aroused suspicion, he was
narrowly watched, and "his speeches taken heed
to", with the result that, as Calderwood states it,
"he was perceaved to be a Papist passing to Spaine,
to traffique betwixt the King of Spaine and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Scottish noblemen". Andrew Knox, to whom the
information was brought, lost no time in setting
himself upon the track of the suspected conspirator.
Accompanied by a number of Glasgow students, he
proceeded to Fairlie, where he found, however, that
Ker had already crossed over to the Cumbrae. Following
him to the island, he succeeded in apprehending
him just as he was ready to embark. On
being searched, his coffers were found to contain
"diverse letters and blankes directed from George
Erle of Huntlie, Francis Erle of Erroll, and William
Erle of Angus, the Lairds of Auchindoun and Fintrie,
and other practisers, some in Latine, some in
Frenche, together with their caschets and signets".<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">There could be no reasonable doubt that Ladylands
was connected with the plot, which, though
treasonable as to the means to be employed, aimed
at nothing more criminal, even on the showing of
Calderwood, than the "procuring libertie of conscience".
Fortunately for him, however, nothing
was found in the intercepted letters or extorted
from those of the conspirators who had been arrested
that could be turned into legal evidence
against him. Two months after his apprehension
it was reported by the English agent in Edinburgh
that "the arraignement of the Larde of Ladilands
was differed in regarde that the cause and evidence
against him were not rype and sufficient to proove
him gilty of treason".<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
On Sunday, the 25th of March, 1593, he was "lett free out of the Tolbuith
of Edinburgh, at the King's command, foure sureties
being taikin for his re-entering in ward at Glasgow
at the King's pleasure". It was at first intended
that he should be kept in "straite warde", but, by
the influence of the Duke of Athole, from whom he
brought letters with him, he obtained the privileges
of "free warde within the Castle". During his confinement
he was visited by his captor, Andrew Knox,
and it was reported that he had been "wonne, and
was contented bothe to subscribe to the articles of
religion, and also to discover manye practizes and
practisers not yet revealed". The Paisley minister,
however, had but little cause to congratulate himself
on his theological triumph. As soon as Ladylands
had succeeded, by his pretended conversion, in allaying
his jailers' suspicions, and inducing them to relax
their vigilance, he escaped out of the Castle and fled
to the Isle of Bute, whence he subsequently made
his way to the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">For the next four years both Ladylands and Andrew
Knox disappear from contemporary records. But in
the month of February, 1596, Robert Bowes, writing
to England, informs Lord Burghley that the plotting
Laird had returned to Scotland, and "was lurking
about his own house and in parts near Glasgow".
He was said to have offered "uppon twoe or three
lynes of the King's hand to come and reveale to
him great secrets". Though urged to give these
"lynes", James refused to comply, but appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
willing "ether to send one of his owne servants to
attache him or else to derect the Provost of Glasgow
to inclose his house and take him". To those who
knew how little the King sympathized with the coercive
measures enforced by the Presbyterians against
their Catholic fellow subjects, his sincerity was the
subject of considerable doubt. The suspicion expressed
by Bowes that the apprehension of Ladylands
was not likely to be effected by his means
appears to have been justified, for three months
later, in May, 1597&mdash;it is well to remember that
at this time the year began in March&mdash;the "buissy
negociator with the King of Spayne and the Pope"
was still at large, and "banded with some of the
Montgomeries, Stewarts, Murrays, and others, beinge
Papists".<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">On this occasion the object of the conspirators
was "to take and surpryse the island and house of
Aylsaie, in the mouth of the Clyde, a place of good
strength which mycht much annoye the west parts
of Scotland, and to keipe the same for the benifyt
of ther Catholique freinds, domesticall and forraigne".<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
To accomplish their purpose they were reported "to
have prepared and rigged a shipp, furnished with
armour, weapons, powder, lead, and other requesyts
for warr". Still the King seemed disinclined to
adopt stringent measures. But whilst he was hesitating
Andrew Knox solved the difficulty by taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
possession of Ailsa Craig, at the head of a small
body of nineteen men, with whom he stationed himself
on the solitary rock to await the course of
events. Before long, Ladylands, ignorant of Knox's
movements and wholly unconscious of the ambush
laid for him, sailed to Ailsa with thirteen of his
fellow conspirators, intending "to have fortefeit and
victuallit the same for the ressett and comforte of
the Spanishe armey, luiked for be him to have cum
and arryvit". On reaching the spit of shingle on
the east side, which affords the only landing-place,
he found himself suddenly opposed by a band of
determined men, who at once "forgadderit with
him and his compliceis, tuke some of his associates
and desireit himselfe to rander and be takin with
thame, quha wer his awne freindis, meaning nawayis
his hurte nor drawinge of his blude". Though
taken at a disadvantage, the Laird was not of a
temper to yield without a struggle; "withdrawing
himself within the sey cant", he resolutely defended
himself against his opponents till, having been forced
to retreat step by step to the very edge of the cliff,
he was thrust "backwart in the deip, drownit and
perisheit in his awne wilfull and disperat resolution".</p>

<p class="indent">In the heat of the struggle no attention had been
given to the mooring of the boat in which Ladylands
and his accomplices had come across. Not till the
skirmish had ceased was it discovered that it had
drifted out to sea, bearing with it the Laird's
"coffers" and the important documents that they
were believed to contain. This untoward accident,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
however, delayed the clearing up of the plot for but
a short time. A few days later the masterless craft
was picked up off South Annan. In Ladylands'
coffers were found, as had been expected, letters
which revealed the whole extent and importance
of the treasonable scheme in which he had been
engaged.</p>

<p class="indent">It appeared "that the conspiracye to have been
accomplished by the takinge and forcinge of Ailsa
was devysed by the larde of Ladylands, Corronall
(Colonel) Hakerson, and the Spanish Ambassador".</p>

<p class="indent">On the previous October the three conspirators
had met at the town of Nantes, in France, for the
purpose of considering the details of their bold
undertaking of enlisting the men, and raising the
funds necessary for carrying it out. In order to
secure the co-operation of those who, had they
known the size and position of Ailsa Craig, might
have felt considerable doubt as to the advantages
to be derived by obtaining possession of it, the rock
"was termed the island of Guyanna, and given out
as very fertile and commodious for fishinge, but
inhabited by barbarous people, and ance possessed,
not recoverable be noe enemy out of the hands of
men of warr".</p>

<p class="indent">To meet the expenses of the enterprise "ther
was contribution promised by sondry noblemen of
Fraunce, and of Englande, and of Scotland". The
agents to whom the task of levying the "contribution"
was entrusted were Hakerson in France,
Richard Skeldon in England, and in Scotland Ladylands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
himself. It was arranged that Ladylands
should, in the first place, get possession of the
island, and then send William Liddell to Spain
"with message of their interpryse, and to crave
mony and furnishing".</p>

<p class="indent">The papers also gave further details of the special
objects which the conspirators had in view. In the
first place, it was intended to "sett upp and manteyne
ane publique masse in this Islande, quhilk
should be patent (open) to all distressed papists,
where fra so ever they should come". Next to
this, there was to be "ane place of releife and refreshment
to the Spanyart, or rather a porte to
them, at ther arryvall in Ireland". Finally, it was
a part of the plan to establish "ane storehouse to
keip furnishing and all things profytable to the use
of the Erle of Tyrone, with the quhilk Erle, Ladylands,
by his commissioners, had been buissy sen his
last coming to Scotland".</p>

<p class="indent">It may be incidentally mentioned that amongst
those who lent their support to Barclay's wild
scheme, there was one who possesses another and
a better claim to be remembered. It was the
author of <cite>The Cherrie and the Slae</cite>. In the Acts of
the Privy Council<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
it is recorded that Alexander Montgomerie, brother of the Laird of Heslott
(Hasilhead), having failed to appear to answer for
being art and part with the late Hew Barclay of
Ladylands in the treasonable enterprise for the
taking of Hisha for the use of the Spanish army,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
was denounced as a rebel, on the 14th of July, 1597.</p>

<p class="indent">Even after the failure of the first part of the plot
and the death of Ladylands, it was deemed advisable
to provide against the possibility of further
surprise on the part of "some practysers for Ireland
whose eyes were espyed to be sett uppon the place".
But, singular as it must appear, the Scottish Government,
or rather the Scottish King, still remained
inactive. It was through English influence that the
necessary measures of safety were adopted. Bowes,
the English agent, "spoke with and moved the Erle
of Cassilis", obtaining from him a vague promise
"to gyve regarde to yt". As this, however, only
resulted in entrusting the custody of Ailsa to Thomas
Hamilton, whom Bowes considered "not very fytt
for the charge", recourse was again had to the
indefatigable Andrew Knox. He readily undertook
"both to awayte uppon the further progress of the
surpryse, and also to prevent the interpryse in dewe
tyme and sorte as before had been performed". It
does not appear, however, that the Paisley minister
had further occasion to sally forth hurriedly from his
residence, at No. 25 in the High Street, and to display
his energy for the protection of Ailsa. The
whole plot had really collapsed with the death of
the prime mover, the bold and unscrupulous Laird
of Ladylands.</p>

<p class="indent">Not the least singular part of the whole episode
is the treatment of Andrew Knox. Far from securing
for him the favour of the Court, his "action against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the papists and practysers for Spayne" brought upon
him the ill will of some of the most influential nobles
in the realm. It was officially reported by Bowes,
who acknowledged that he himself had been "alwayes
privye with him in these affayres", that he had
"entred into dangerous feuds by his commendable
behaviour", and that "his lyfe was gredely sought
by many and strong persons". The agent's recommendation
that he "should be tymelye and favorablie
comforted" was doubtless acted upon, and it may
be looked upon as the result of the interference of
the English Government that the Privy Council,
"by direction given by His Majesty in his letter
from Striveling upon the 6th of June", issued a
proclamation which recognized Knox's conduct "to
have been loyal and good service done to His
Majesty and the country", and warned all persons,
under pain of treason, against "troubling" any of
those concerned in the expedition which had resulted
in the death of the Laird of Ladylands.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">With this one episode the history of Ailsa Craig
seems to have begun and ended. There is no trace
of its connection with the political events of any
previous or subsequent period.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF A BALLAD&mdash;<br />"KINMONT WILLIE"</h2>

<p class="indent">The ballad of "Kinmont Willie", as to the genuineness
of which we are not among those who entertain
doubts that reflect on the good faith of Sir Walter
Scott, is not only one of the most spirited to be
found in all the Border minstrelsy, it is also noteworthy
as being in the number of the comparatively
few popular poems that have a real historical event
as their foundation. And a further interest attaches
to it from the circumstance that the incident which
it sets forth was of sufficient importance to give rise
to a diplomatic correspondence between the Ministers
of James VI and those of Elizabeth, and, indeed, to
be the subject of an indignant letter from the Queen
herself. The actual facts of the capture and rescue
of William Armstrong, commonly known as Kinmont
Willie, are in the main such as they are
related in the ballad.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1596, on one of those customary "days of
truce" agreed upon by the officials on both sides
of the Border for the purpose of discussing and, if
it were possible, of settling in a friendly manner any
quarrels that might have arisen between the turbulent
inhabitants of the respective marches, Thomas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Salkeld, the "fause Sakelde" of the ballad, as deputy
for the English Warden, Lord Scroope, had met
Robert Scott of Haning, the representative of Sir
Walter Scott, "the Bauld Buccleuch", Keeper of
Liddisdale. The conference had taken place at a
spot where the Kershope, a small tributary of the
Liddel, formed the boundary line between the two
countries. Nothing untoward had happened. The
two officials had parted on friendly terms, and the
Scots Borderers, of whom Robert Scott's escort consisted,
had set out for their respective homes. One
of these happened to be William Armstrong of Kinmont.
He was well known to the Englishmen as
a "bauld reiver", against whom they had many
a complaint of long standing.</p>

<p class="indent">It was well understood that the "days of truce"
lasted until sunrise on the morning after the breaking
up of the meeting, so that all who had been
present at it might have ample time to perform the
return journey homewards without being exposed to
molestation. Trusting to this, Armstrong, whose
way lay in the same direction as that of the English
Borderers, rode on unconcernedly on his own side
of the Liddel and in full sight of them. Their
sense of honour was not proof against the temptation
of availing themselves of so favourable an opportunity.
Making it an excuse for their violation of
Border law that at one point Armstrong was obliged
to pass out of the territory included in Buccleuch
jurisdiction, they crossed the stream, thus committing
an act of invasion, fell upon him at such odds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
as made resistance vain, took him prisoner and carried
him off to Carlisle, where he was lodged in the
Castle. The indignation aroused by this unwarrantable
breach of faith was all the greater from the fact
that Willie was popular amongst his kinsmen and
neighbours for the daring and resourcefulness which
had often ensured the success of the raids on which
they had sallied out together. Buccleuch protested
against the violation of the truce and demanded
Kinmont's liberation; but his remonstrances produced
no result. Neither was the Scottish Government
itself more successful with Scroope when the
general outcry obliged it to interfere.</p>

<p class="indent">Buccleuch then resolved to take the law into his
own hands. As a first step towards the execution
of the bold plan which he had conceived, he got his
signet ring conveyed to the prisoner. This he contrived
to do through the agency of one of the
Grames, who, though English Borderers themselves,
appear, from Scroope's repeated complaints against
them, to have been in league with the Scottish
Warden. A horse race promoted by him afforded
him an opportunity of communicating with Kinmont's
kinsmen and friends without exciting suspicion. He
had no difficulty in enlisting recruits, mainly from
amongst the Scotts, the Elliots, the Bells, and, as a
matter of course, the Armstrongs, including Willie's
sons. Before Kinmont, whose capture had been
effected on March 17, had been a month in Carlisle
Castle, where, after promising that he would make
no attempt at escape, he appears to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
treated with some consideration, everything was
ready for a dash into England.</p>

<p class="indent">On the evening of April 13, a troop of horsemen
numbering five hundred, according to Scroope's estimate
of them, crossed the Border in a storm of wind
and rain. They were led by Buccleuch, who, before
passing into English territory, left one detachment
under the Laird of Johnston, and another with the
Goodman of Bonshawe, to lie in ambush close to the
frontier line in order to check pursuit if, as might
well happen, the raiders should return with the English
at their heels. Those that rode on towards Carlisle
were provided with gavelocks, crowbars, pickaxes,
axes, and scaling ladders. They reached the Castle
at dead of night, and, making for the postern, set
about undermining it. The guards had either fallen
asleep or got under cover to protect themselves from
the violence of the weather; moreover, the howling
of the storm covered the noise unavoidably made
by the sappers, quietly as they tried to work, and
nothing happened to give either Scroope or Salkeld,
both of whom were within the walls, the least warning
of what was going on. In a short time the Scots
had penetrated into the courtyard. Buccleuch was
the fifth to pass through the trench. When he had
the rescuing party about him he encouraged them
to "Stand to it", as he had vowed to God and his
Prince to fetch Kinmont out of England dead or alive;
and assured them that, when it was done, he would
maintain his action "with fire and sword against all
resisters". With this he led them to the room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
where Will Armstrong was confined. Here one of
Scroope's servants, who had been stationed as a
guard, had to be overpowered, and sustained some
slight injuries. The door was broken open and
Armstrong was carried off. As the rescuers were
retiring they encountered two men of the outer
watch. These were promptly prevented from giving
the alarm, but escaped with their lives, Buccleuch
having given strict orders that no unnecessary violence
should be used and no wanton damage done,
lest their enterprise should appear to have had other
objects in view than the rescue for which it was
solely planned. Then the whole party galloped
back to Scotland with their prize.</p>

<p class="indent">Even in those days news of so startling an occurrence
spread fast. Within a few weeks the daring
exploit had aroused the keenest excitement in both
North and South Britain. In Scotland Buccleuch's
action "was greatly commended by the great people".
In England there was a feeling of intense indignation
at the "outrageous fact". Robert Bowes, the
Ambassador at the Court of King James, gave expression
to it at a Convention of the Estates. He had
been commissioned to "aggravate the heinousness"
of the aggression, and did so in a long oration,
"concluding that peace could no longer continue
betwixt the two realms unless Buccleuch was delivered
into England, to be punished at the Queen's
pleasure".<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
The Keeper of Liddisdale was present,
and spoke in his own defence. He maintained that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
in rescuing a Scottish subject who had been wrongfully
captured, he had done nothing but what honour
dictated and duty required. He declared, however,
that he was willing to submit the case to Commissioners
appointed by the English Queen on the one
hand, and by the Scottish King on the other, and to
abide by their decision. This suggestion met with
the approval of the Estates, who accordingly proposed
that, "conform to the ancient treaties of peace, and
custom observed between the two realms, Scottish
and English Commissioners should meet on the
Borders to decide upon the said complaint".</p>

<p class="indent">The Estates had come to this decision on the
25th of May. A few days later, on the 4th of
June, James himself wrote to Elizabeth in regard
to the "late attempt of Buccleuch". He begged
her to bear in mind that all the information she
had so far received proceeded from her own officer
who, as a direct party in the matter, might reasonably
be suspected of partiality. And he urged this
as a reason for her consenting to the appointment of
a Commission, in accordance with the proposal made
by Buccleuch and adopted by the Convention. Before
the end of the same month, both the Privy
Council of England and Queen Elizabeth had dispatched
replies to Edinburgh. The former, after
communicating her Majesty's dissatisfaction at what
had taken place and at the turn which matters were
taking, confined itself to the expression of a hope
that the King, in his own princely judgment, would
reverse the Act of his Council, and not show favour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
to a person so notoriously reported to be factious,
seditious, and a favourer of the King's rebels.</p>

<p class="indent">The Queen's letter was far more uncompromising
in its tone. It contained an emphatic refusal to
entertain any thought of a Commission, and it prefaced
this vigorously-worded decision with a rebuke
such as might have been administered to a naughty
child. She told James that she looked upon him as
a rare example of a king seduced by evil information.
Was it ever seen that a prince, from his
cradle preserved from slaughter, upheld in Royal
dignity, preserved from many treasons, maintained
in all sorts of kindness, should remunerate with so
hard measure such dear deservings, and hesitate to
yield a just reply to a friend's lawful demand?
Ought there to be any question as to whether a
King should act rightfully by his equal, and should
his Councillors be asked their pleasure as to what
he might do? Had this occurred in the nonage of
the Prince, it might have some colour; but in a
"fatherage" it seemed strange, and, she dared say,
was without example. However little regard her
"dear Brother" might have for herself, yet she
would grieve much to see him neglectful of his own
dignity, as the English, whose good opinion she
doubted not but he had in some esteem, would
measure his love by his deeds, and not by his words
on paper. In so far as she was concerned, she told
him plainly that she considered herself as ill treated
by her professed friend as she could be by her
declared foe. Was any castle of hers to be assailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
by a night-prowler and her ally not send the
offender to his due punisher? Should a friend stick
at a demand that he ought rather to anticipate?
For other doubtful and litigious Border cases she
was willing to appoint Commissioners, if she found
it needful, but never in a matter of such villainous
usage as this.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
Nor was this the worst. James was
further informed, and that not in a private letter,
but through Bowes, that Elizabeth had resolved to
stop his yearly gratuity if he did not satisfy her in
the redress demanded against Buccleuch.</p>

<p class="indent">The correspondence of the time shows that of all
who were variously affected by Buccleuch's raid, it
was James who, all along, found himself in the most
difficult and delicate position. Whilst willing to
conciliate Elizabeth, he hesitated to condemn an
action of which his subjects were proud as of a
triumph over England. He now began to understand
that he would have to yield to the imperious
Queen. But he was still anxious to delay the
inevitable surrender, knowing that amongst the
people generally the feeling of opposition to the
delivery of Buccleuch was as keen as ever. As a
means of gaining time, he raised a new issue, by
writing a strong letter of indignation at the Queen
of England's threat to stay the payment of his
annuity, and at her treatment of him as if he were
her pensioner, whereas the money that he received
was in return for concessions he had made. This,
he thought, was a greater breach of the alliance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
between them than his not giving up Buccleuch;
and to prove that he, for his part, had always been
faithful to it, he recapitulated the various acts by
which he had always shown his attachment to
England.</p>

<p class="indent">This led to a prolongation of the correspondence
and negotiations between the two countries; and
matters dragged on in this way till the month of
August, when Bowes was at length able to inform
Lord Burghley that Buccleuch had been commanded
to ward by the King, and that the place of his detention
was St. Andrews. Recognizing this as a
step in the right direction, Elizabeth wrote to James
to express her satisfaction at his having done what
beseemed him. At the same time she gave him to
understand that she would not consider herself
fairly dealt with until Buccleuch was delivered up
to herself. This was again followed by a long
exchange of communications, of which the tone,
however, marked a gradual approach towards a
settlement of the dispute. Before that was reached,
James found an opportunity of retaliating in a
characteristically petty manner. As Elizabeth insisted
that Buccleuch should be delivered over to
her for punishment because of his attack on Carlisle
Castle, so he demanded that Edmund Spenser should
be called to account for his reflections on the character
of Mary Stuart. What we know about this
new and singular development is contained in a
dispatch from Bowes to Burghley. "The King,"
writes the English agent in Edinburgh, "has conceived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
great offence against Edmund Spenser, for
publishing in print, in the second part of the <cite>Faerie
Queen</cite>, chapter IX, some dishonourable effects, as
the King deemeth, against himself and his mother
deceased. I have satisfied the King about the
privilege under which the book is published, yet
he still desireth that Edmund Spenser, for this
fault, may be duly tried and punished." It does
not appear from anything to be found in the State
Papers that this frivolous matter received serious
attention on the part of Elizabeth, or was further
insisted upon by James himself.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">As for the Border incident, after all these negotiations,
enquiries, and recriminations, it was brought
to a close by Buccleuch's surrendering himself into
English custody at Berwick. His captivity lasted
from October 6th, 1597, till March 21st following.
On his release his ten-year-old child took his place
as a hostage. It is noteworthy that the redoubtable
Borderer not only ceased to give trouble, but even
co-operated with the English Wardens in maintaining
peace in the marches. There is said to be a
tradition in the Buccleuch family that he was
presented to Elizabeth, who admired him for his
daring, in spite of the annoyance which it had
caused her.</p>

<h2>A RAID ON THE WEE CUMBRAE</h2>

<p class="indent">Just off the east side of that southern part of the
Little Cumbrae which is included in the parish of
West Kilbride, and on a low-lying turf and weed-covered
rock, which, according to the ebb and the
flood of the tide, is itself alternately a peninsula or
an islet, there stands the ruin of an ancient castle.
It is still a massive pile of masonry, the ground
plan of which nearly forms a square, the difference
between length and breadth being less than ten feet.
Its distance from the Ayrshire coast and from Millport,
on the Great Cumbrae, is about the same; and
owing to the comparative inaccessibility which the
two or three miles of sea give it, its interior is somewhat
less dilapidated than is usually the case with
similar relics of the past to be met with on the
mainland. The partition walls of the several rooms
have, it is true, almost disappeared, so that, for
instance, the storey immediately above the vaults
on the ground floor would appear to have consisted
of one hall, if it were not for the fact that it contains
two large chimneys. The ceilings are arched
throughout, and it is doubtless due to this architectural
peculiarity that each of them is still intact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
and supplies a solid floor for the storey immediately
above. The narrow stone staircase is still practicable
in its first flight, but fragmentary and rather unsafe
beyond that. In its general appearance the Cumbrae
castle is very similar to that of Portencross, over the
water. It is probable that they both date from the
same period, and are the work of the same builder.
Both belonged to the Boyd family.</p>

<p class="indent">At the present day the Wee Cumbrae, as it is
popularly called, is practically uninhabited. At its
westermost point it has a lighthouse with the usual
staff, and opposite the castle itself there are two
houses serving, the one as a shooting-box, the other
as a dwelling for the present tenant's gamekeeper.
Closer examination of the island, particularly in
winter, when the ground is free from bracken, reveals
the remains of a dozen or more cottages,
which tell of the existence in former days of a small
colony on the less exposed half of it.</p>

<p class="indent">In the last year of the sixteenth century several
of the families that composed the small population
were of the name of Montgomery. The castle
itself was inhabited by Robert Boyd of Badinhaith.
He was a man of some initiative, and had formed
a plan for the building of a harbour for "the commone
welle and benefite of the haill liegeis of this
realme haveing ony trade and handling in the west
seyis". In the year 1599, as a first step towards
the accomplishment of this praiseworthy scheme, he
had purchased "eleven score of joists of oak of
twenty-four foot long and a foot and a half of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
square". The cost of each joist was &pound;8, and the
whole outlay amounted to &pound;1760. Although this,
being in Scots currency, represented less than &pound;150
sterling, the sum in view of the value of money
in those days was not inconsiderable.</p>

<p class="indent">Whatever may have been the relation in which
Robert Boyd stood to the other inhabitants of the
Little Cumbrae, their attitude towards him was distinctly
hostile. There is good reason to believe
that these immediate neighbours of his were not
all respectable, peace-abiding folk, but that the
island served as a convenient refuge for "rebels,
fugitives, and ex-communicates". And it is quite
intelligible that these outlaws did not approve of
the laird's enterprise, one of the results of which
would be to bring their sea-girt asylum into
closer touch with the outer world and its justice.
Whether for this reason or for the mere sake of
plunder, it happened that one day, in 1599, some
thirty men, with half a dozen of the Montgomerys
as their leaders, came to the fortalice with hagbuts,
pistols, culverins, swords, and other weapons, and
violently, "with engyne of smythis", broke up the
doors and gates, and, after having destroyed the
glass windows, boards, and ironwork, "spuilzied"
the furniture, together with the materials intended
for the construction of the harbour. The perpetration
of this outrage was followed by the forcible
occupation of the castle by four of the Montgomerys,
who fortified it "with men, ammunition,
and armour", and "resetted within it not only the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
disorderit thevis and lymmaris of the Ilis, but also
such other malefactors as, for eschewing punishment,
resorted towards them".</p>

<p class="indent">The document<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
which contains the narrative of the "spulzie" on the Little Cumbrae is interesting,
not only because of the glimpse which it affords of
the state of the country three hundred years ago,
but also, and even more, because of the minute
inventory which it includes of the articles either
"spulzied" or destroyed in the various parts and
chambers of Boyd's castle, together with the value
put upon each article or set of articles. In the first
place the list indicates the internal structural arrangement
of such a dwelling. It consisted of a
hall, a kitchen, a chamber, a lower wester chamber
and a high wester chamber, a low easter chamber,
a wardrobe, a brew-house, and vaults. The contents
of the several apartments do not point to
luxurious appointment, even in what may be taken
as a fair specimen of an ancient Scottish house of
the larger and better sort.</p>

<p class="indent">The distinction between public rooms and bedrooms
does not appear to have existed. There were
two or three "stand beds", that is to say, beds with
posts, as distinguished from beds that might be
folded up, in each of the "chambers". Most of
them were of "fir", or plain deal, and valued at
&pound;8 Scots, or 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> sterling, each. The oak
bedsteads, of which there were only two, were set down
at 20 marks, or about 23<i>s.</i> sterling apiece. According
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
to the same difference of wood, the "chalmer
buirds", as distinct from the "fauldand buird", or
dining-table of the kitchen, were worth &pound;4 or &pound;5
respectively. Three beds and a table constituted
the sole furniture of the "low easter chalmer" and
of the "high wester chalmer". The "lower wester
chalmer" was the room which yielded most loot to
the raiders. In a cupboard within it they found a
"silver piece" of 17 oz. in weight and a cup with
a silver foot weighing 7 oz., at &pound;3, that is to say,
5<i>s.</i> an ounce, besides "contracts, obligations, evidents,
and books, worth &pound;2000." The same room
contained a lockfast chest, which served as a repository
for "a doublet and breiks of dun fustian cut
out on tawny taffety, a pair of tawny worsted stockings,
two linen shirts, two pairs of linen sheets,
four pillowslips, two pairs of tablecloths, two broad
cloths of linen of five ells in length, two broad towels,
and two dozen serviettes".</p>

<p class="indent">In the kitchen the utensils were on a scale as
moderate as that of the furniture through the whole
house. The items which it supplies in the inventory
are: Two brass pots, two pans, two spits, a
pair of andirons, an iron ladle, a dozen and a half
of plates, knives, forks, and spoons for six people,
a dozen trenchers, and a folding table. The only
engines of war contained in Boyd's fortalice consisted
of two "cut-throat guns of iron". They
were located in the hall. The whole damage done
by the plunder of all the movables and the destruction
of such fixtures as doors and windows is estimated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
at &pound;4776, 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Scots, that is, well under
&pound;400 sterling. By no stretch of the imagination
can the raid of the Little Cumbrae be considered an
event of historical importance. It is rescued from
insignificance, however, by virtue of the valuable
data which it has been the indirect means of preserving
for the information of posterity.</p>

<h2>RIOTOUS GLASGOW</h2>

<p class="indent">In 1605 Glasgow could lay no claim to the position
of second city of the kingdom that had virtually,
though not yet legally, become United by reason of
the accession of James VI of Scotland to the English
throne. It was not in the first rank, even on
its own side of the Tweed, and in a gracious and
flattering reference to its condition and estate His
Majesty could not go beyond the qualified statement
that, "in quantitie and number of trafficquers and
others inhabitants", it was inferior to few of the
cities and burghs in his northern dominions.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
There was, indeed, one matter with regard to which it stood
on a lower municipal level than either Edinburgh or
Perth, Stirling or Dundee. In the choice of its
Provost and Magistrates it did not enjoy the full
freedom that was the privilege of those more important
centres of population.</p>

<p class="indent">Prior to the Reformation, and as late after it as
the closing year of the sixteenth century, the nomination
of the Provost and the selection of the Bailies
lay with the Archbishops as temporal, no less than
spiritual, superiors of Glasgow. In 1600, however,
the King, by a charter dated November 17th,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
granted to Ludovic, Duke of Lennox, the castle of
Glasgow and the heritable right of appointing the
civic rulers.</p>

<p class="indent">On September 30th of the same year, Sir George
Elphinstone of Blythswood appeared before the
Town Council, and presented a letter from Duke
Ludovic nominating him Provost for the ensuing
year. He was also the bearer of an official communication
from the King himself, whose friend and
favourite he was, and who warmly recommended
him for the dignity. The nomination of Sir George,
a clever lawyer, who subsequently rose to the rank
of Lord Justice-Clerk, appears to have been popular,
and he was duly accepted.</p>

<p class="indent">With regard to the election of Bailies, the Council
was less accommodating. The letter brought by
Elphinstone directed that the leet from which a
selection was to be made should be submitted, not
to himself, but to the Sheriff, to whom he delegated
his authority. Such a course was objected to as
being both derogatory and contrary to use and
wont; and the Council firmly refused to present
the leet to any substitute, or to recognize any nomination
but such as came from his Lordship's own
mouth. In accordance with the resolution arrived
at in vindication of their dignity, the Corporation
sent Thomas Pettigrew, as its commissioner, to
Brechin, where the Duke was staying at the time,
and, through him, submitted a list of eight names
from which Lennox was to select three.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Unprepared as was Duke Ludovic for such
prompt and resolute action on the part of the
Glasgow Municipality, he adopted the judicious
course of yielding temporary acquiescence to its
claims, and on October 7th, Pettigrew was able to
report, as the successful result of his mission, that
Robert Rowat, James Forett, and Alexander Baillie
had been chosen to fill the vacant magisterial seats.
Owing to a regrettable gap of nearly four years in
the Burgh Records, it is impossible to ascertain what
further steps were taken by either side during the
period extending from October 27th, 1601, to June
13th, 1605. The only available information bearing
on this point is to be gathered from the Register
of the Privy Council of Scotland. From a statement
to be found there, it appears that Lennox had
not maintained his conciliatory attitude towards the
Town Council, but that, persisting in his original
course, he had devised a means by which the Stewarts
of Minto had, under him, "the exercise of the
officeis of the said town in their personis".<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">By August 3rd, 1605, the Municipal Authorities
had realized that a greater power than theirs was
required to secure for them the free exercise of
what they claimed to be rights and privileges sanctioned
by the King. On that day a deputation,
headed by Sir George Elphinstone and consisting
of the Dean of Guild, of one of the Bailies, and of
four Councillors, was appointed to go to Edinburgh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
to settle and end the matter by an appeal to the
Privy Council. This further step having proved
unavailing, the Corporation, on the 27th of the
same month, "ernestlie requestit and desyrit" their
Provost to undertake a journey to London, in order
to invoke the intervention and aid of James himself.
Thanks to Sir George's personal influence and to
the favour in which he stood with his sovereign, as
much, perhaps, as to the justice of his cause, Lennox
was at length prevailed upon to grant the persistent
petitioners "the full libertie, fredome, and priviledge
of the electioun of thair Magistrattis", without, however,
renouncing in any other respect his right of
justiciary and bailliary of regality within and around
the city.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir George Elphinstone's colleagues were not slow
to give practical expression to the gratitude that
they felt for his public-spirited conduct and to the
value that they set on the success of his efforts on
their behalf. On October 2nd, 1665, after he had
been "removeit of Counsall", they all, with one
voice, in respect of the singular care, great zeal and
love had and borne by him to the weal and liberty
of the Burgh, nominated, elected, and chose him for
their Provost. On the same day and in the further
exercise of the freedom which he had secured, a list
of nine names, including those of three of the "auld
Bailies", was submitted to the remainder of the
Council, who, by plurality of votes, chose William
Anderson, Mathew Turnbull, and Robert Rowat.
In recognition of the honour conferred upon them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the new Provost and Magistrates renounced the
right which the custom of the time appears to have
given them, to the fines levied for certain offences.</p>

<p class="indent">Amongst the citizens of Glasgow there was a
minority which, looking at the extension of municipal
liberty from the point of view of personal interest,
felt deeply aggrieved by the new system of
magisterial election. It consisted of the members
and friends of the house of Minto, a family which
had for many generations possessed considerable
local influence, and of which the head, Sir Mathew
Stewart, had himself filled the position of Provost.
It was plain to them, however, that as long as the
Council remained united, resistance would be futile,
and that their only hope of worsting their opponents
lay in dividing them.</p>

<p class="indent">For the attainment of this object the means that
suggested itself as most feasible was the formation
of a faction amongst the craftsmen of the city, "for
the most part rude and ignorant men", of whom
plausible arguments might make blind and determined
partisans. The deacons of some of the
numerous crafts or incorporations were first approached.
The Stewarts represented to them that
the liberty newly acquired by the Council was
"nothing else but a manifest thraldom and tyranny
against the crafts, a dissolution of the estate of the
town, and an heritable establishing of the offices and
jurisdiction of the town in the persons of a small
number". So widely and successfully did the agitators
propagate their "subtile and fals informatioun"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
that in the end it was "embraced for a
treuth be the haill ignorant multitude".</p>

<p class="indent">Encouraged by these results, Sir Mathew Stewart
saw his way to give more definite and formal shape
to his opposition. Shortly before the time when the
Provost and his fellow Magistrates were to apply to
Parliament for the ratification of their liberty and
freedom of election he convoked a meeting, which
was held at seven o'clock in the morning, in the
house of John Ross, a Town Councillor whom he
had won over to his side, and at which between
forty and fifty prominent citizens were present.
The malcontents drew up a petition against the
ratification craved by the Town Council, and, after
having appended their several signatures to it, entrusted
it to John Ross, James Braidwood, deacon-general,
and Ninian Anderson, deacon of the Cordwainers,
to be presented to the Lords of the Articles,
by whom its prayer was duly granted.</p>

<p class="indent">To protect themselves from the consequences of
proceedings that might be made to appear factious
and seditious, seeing that the meeting had taken
place without the presence, knowledge, or consent
of the Magistrates, the Stewarts procured from the
Lords of Council and Session an exemption in favour
of all who had subscribed the application.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the sequel there is only one detailed account.
It is contained in the complaint subsequently brought
before the Privy Council by the Provost and Magistrates,
and embodying what is essentially the official
view of the case. Whilst it would be unjustifiable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
to impugn the veracity of this document, there can
be no doubt that it places facts in the light least
favourable to the agitators; and that in the motives
and intentions which it imputes to them it goes
further than those facts seem to warrant. It sets
forth that, the further to irritate and incense the
common multitude against the Magistrates, and to
make it appear that they had credit and power to
overthrow these at their pleasure, Minto and his
accomplices, accompanied by a crowd of some three
or four score, all in arms, with targets, swords, and
other invasive weapons, came in a very tumultuous
and unseemly manner to the Market Cross, whilst
the Magistrates were sitting in Council close by;
and that, disdaining to ask for the key of the Cross,
although it was lying in the Tolbooth ready to be
delivered to them, they clambered in, and proclaimed
their exemption, "quhilk in effect importit a liberty
to thame to do quhat they pleasit, without controlment".</p>

<p class="indent">It is alleged that the object of this "tumultuous
and barbarous" demonstration was to draw the
Magistrates from the Council chamber, and to
tempt them to find fault with the proceedings,
which would have supplied a pretence for fastening
a quarrel upon them and "persewing them of their
liveis". If such a design really existed, it was frustrated
by the conciliatory attitude assumed by the
Provost and his colleagues. Seeing the wisdom of
coming to terms with the malcontents, they made
arrangements for a conference with the deacons, who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
next to the Stewarts themselves, appear to have
taken the most prominent part in the movement.
The meeting was to take place on July 24th, 1606;
and all the ministers in the city, together with the
regents of the College, were summoned to attend it.</p>

<p class="indent">According to the official account, the Stewarts
were apprehensive of the result of the appointed
conference, and resolved "to procure some trouble
and unquietness in the citie", for the purpose of
preventing it from being held. Three of them, it
is alleged&mdash;Sir Walter, John, and Alexander&mdash;knowing
that Sir George Elphinstone had arranged to
shoot off an archery match at the Castle butts, on
the evening of July 23, lay in wait for him near the
Drygate with a band of some forty men close at
hand at the Wyndhead&mdash;all "bodin in feir of weir",
that is, equipped for a warlike expedition, with steel
bonnets, secret armour, plait sleeves, longstaffs, and
other weapons. As the Provost and his friends, who
were but five in number and bore no arms but their
unbended bows, reached the Drygate, one of them,
James Forrett, left the party for the purpose of
fetching some arrows from his house. Before he
could reach it, Sir Walter, uttering insulting language,
attacked him with drawn sword. By this
time Sir George had reached the Castle gate, but
hearing the altercation, he turned back and endeavoured
to pacify the assailant with "fair and gentle"
words. "Sir," he said, "I pray you to go youre
way; no man sal offend you." His request was
unheeded; and then, by the authority of his office,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
as Provost of the city, he commanded Sir Walter, in
His Majesty's name, to go his way.</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the alleged accomplices made their
appearance on the scene, and "concurring together,
maist cruelli and feirslie set upoun Sir George, and
be force and violence drave him and his company
back to the Castell porte, quhair he was fred and
relevit of the present danger". Thereupon the
Stewarts and their party retired to the Wyndhead,
where they remained, whilst James Braidwood, by
their direction, ran down the High Street, crying:
"Arme you! arme you! They are yokit!" This
brought up a reinforcement of some two score
"airmed men of the seditious faction", headed by
Sir Mathew Stewart. With united forces and
"with grite furie", the rioters made an onset on
the Castle gate, where the Provost was still in
shelter. They were checked by the Earl of Wigtown,
the Master of Montrose, and the Laird of
Kilsyth, three of His Majesty's Privy Councillors,
who happened to be at hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Being unable to get at Sir George with their longstaffs
and weapons, they spitefully threw a volley of
stones at him, then rushed tumultuously and apparently
aimlessly, "doun the gait to the Barras
yet, far beneth the Croce". The tumult, however,
was not yet over. Once again the crowd made for
the Castle gate, swollen by the accession of some
300 of the "rascall multitude", whom the prospect
of plunder had attracted, and who, as they trooped
on, indicated their intentions by calling out to each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
other, "I sall have this buith and thou sall have
that buith". Before their arrival the Provost had
been removed to the shelter of the Earl of Wigtown's
mansion. An attempt was made to storm it;
but the Privy Councillors again intervened, and succeeded
in dispersing the rioters.</p>

<p class="indent">The Privy Councillors, to whose opportune intervention
the quelling of the disturbance was mainly
due, at once took vigorous measures to prevent the
recurrence of outbreaks. The Lairds of Minto were
confined by them to the Castle of Dumbarton, whilst
Sir George Elphinstone and James Forrett were interned
in that of Glasgow. On August 9th, the
ward was changed in both cases to the town of
Stirling, where the several parties were bound to
remain under caution in sums ranging from 5000
merks to &pound;5000, to keep the king's peace. Of the
other persons implicated, some were charged to enter
ward in Perth, others in Dundee. The 28th of the
same month was appointed for the meeting of the
Council in Stirling, "to tak tryell in this commotion
of Glasgow". The venue was, however, subsequently
changed owing to the breaking out of the
plague.</p>

<p class="indent">It happened that a fortnight before the Minto
riots, on July 9th, 1606, Parliament had passed an
"Act for Staying of Unlawful Conventions within
Burgh". The Glasgow disturbance was the first
occurrence that called for the application of this Act.
It was embodied in a "proclamation about Glasgow",
issued by the Privy Council on July 31st. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
preamble referred to the many good Acts of Parliament
made by the king and his predecessors, with
regard to the modest, good, and peaceable behaviour
of the inhabitants within burgh, and to the staying
of all tumults, unlawful meetings and convocations,
"quhairby it is expressly prohibite and forbidden
that all manner of persons within burgh, of quhatsumever
rank, qualitie, or condition thai be of,
presume or take upon hand, under quhatsumever
cullor or pretext, to convein or assemble thaimselffis
upon any occasion, except thai make due intimation
of the lawfull causes of thair meittings to the Provost
and Baillies of the burgh, and obtain thair
licence thairto, and that nothing salbe done be thaim
in thair saids meittings quhilk may tend to the
derogation or violation of the Acts of Parliament,
lawis and constitutions made for the wele and quietness
of the said burghs"; and whereby also, "the
saids unlawfull meittings, and the persons present
thereat, are by the saids Acts of Parliament declairit
to be factious and seditious; and all thair proceidings
thairin to be null and of non availl, and the
saids persons ordained to be punished in thair bodies
and gear with all rigour". This was followed by
a narrative of the recent disturbance between the
citizens and the Magistrates&mdash;"A thing very undecent
and unseamlie and without ony preceiding
example in ony burgh within this kingdome". Then
came instructions to the officers of arms to pass to
the Mercat Cross of Glasgow and there, by open
proclamation, "to command and charge the haill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
inhabitants of the said citie to lay asyde thair armour
immediatelie after the publication heirof, conteyne
thaimselfis in quietness, and behave them as modest,
quiet, and peaceable citizens, forbearing to convocat
or assemble upon ony occasion thaimselfis togidder
fra this tyme furth, under quhatsumever cullor or
pretext, without the knowledge, consent, and licence
of the saids Magistrates, nor yit to do, practize nor
attempt anything hurtfull or prejudiciall to the saids
Acts of Parliament, lawis and constitutions of the
said citie: certifying thaim that sall do in the contrair,
that thai salbe repute, haldin, esteimit, perseuit
and punisht as factious and seditious persons, perturbers
of the peace and quiet of the said citie, with
all rigour and extreamitie, conforme to his Hienes
laws and Acts of Parliament made thairanent".</p>

<p class="indent">Complaints had been laid before the Privy Council,
on the one side by the Provost and Magistrates of
the City of Glasgow against the Stewarts and their
abettors, on the other by Sir Walter Stewart of
Arthurlie against Sir George Elphinstone and the
friends who accompanied him on the eventful evening
of July 23rd. Both cases were heard in Edinburgh
on August 27th, 1606. With respect to that
in which the opponents of the Corporation were the
defenders, it was declared that those persons had
committed a "verie grite insolence and ryot". For
this they were condemned to be warded in the
burgh of Linlithgow till His Majesty's will was made
known concerning them. At the same time the
Lords "assoilzed simpliciter" the Lairds of Minto,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
elder and younger, and all the other defenders, from
forethought felony intended against the pursuers,
and from the charge of "thair lying at await" for
the Provost at the Wyndhead of the city, the pursuers
having failed to prove that part of their complaint.
On similar grounds, decree of absolvitor
was pronounced in favour of Sir George Elphinstone
and his fellow defenders in the suit brought
against them at the instance of Sir Walter Stewart.</p>

<p class="indent">The King's pleasure was made known to his
Privy Council in a letter dated from Hampton
Court on October 1st, 1606. After expressing his
astonishment that the information communicated to
him was so scant as to render it impossible for him
to "mak ony distinctioun of offendouris in that
ryotte, that, according to the difference of thair
faultis, directioun micht haif bene gevin for inflicting
upoun several personis the moir mylde and
moir hard punishment", His Majesty directed that
the meaner offenders should be released, after being
bound in "greate pecunnial sowmes for their due
obedience to the Magistrates", but that the Lairds
of Minto, elder and younger, should both be "fynned
in great sowmes", and retained in ward until these
were paid.</p>

<p class="indent">Such is the information to be gathered concerning
an incident which is of sufficient importance in itself
to be recorded with greater detail than is given in
the local histories written before the publication of
the <cite>Register of the Privy Council</cite>. Another circumstance
that lends interest to the happily unique collision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
between the municipal authorities and the
citizens, is the coincidence that it was the first
occasion for the application of an Act to which,
exactly three hundred years later, the Magistrates of
Glasgow found it expedient to appeal for the staying
of such "unlawfull conventions within burgh" as
the mustering and parading of street bands.</p>

<h2>THE OLD SCOTTISH ARMY</h2>

<p class="indent">One of the earliest, if indeed it be not actually the
most ancient of extant enactments for the organization
of the national forces of Scotland, is a Latin
document drawn up in the form and style of a
proclamation and purporting to be based on "the
Book of Wyntoun laws". It is undated, but this
reference to Edward I's Statute of Winchester
shows it to have been subsequent to the year 1285.
This Scottish adaptation of the English system required
every man between sixteen and sixty years
of age to be provided with defensive and offensive
armour in proportion to the quantity of lands and
chattels which he possessed. The owner of chattels
to the value of 40 marks was to have a horse; an
habergeon, or sleeveless coat of mail; a chaplet,
that is to say, an iron skull-cap without vizor; a
sword, and "a knife called dagger". The equipment
of such as held land worth 40<i>s.</i> or upwards,
but less than 100<i>s.</i>, was to consist of a bow and
arrows, a dagger, and a knife; and, in their case,
the absence of defensive armour suggests that they
were intended as light infantry. The lesser people,
with an income under 40<i>s.</i> were expected to have
a hand-axe, bow and arrows. All others, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
means allowed of it, were to be armed with a bow
and arrows if they dwelt outside forest lands, or a
bow and "pyles" if within them. These pyles
being square-headed quarrels or bolts, it may be
supposed that the use of them was prescribed because
they were looked upon as less suitable for the
purposes of poaching. The same ordinance also
enjoined that there should be two wapenshaws or
inspections every year.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Earlier, though more incidental indication of a
system of military service, is to be found, however,
in an enactment which is ascribed to William the
Lion, who began his reign in 1165, and which set
forth that if a man borrowed a horse to join the
King's army and the horse were challenged as stolen,
he was to be allowed respite until his return to the
county within which he alleged that the horse had
been lent him. And, rather more than half a century
later, in 1220, under Alexander II, further
evidence of military obligation is supplied by a
statute fixing the fines to be imposed on men of
various ranks for remaining away from the King's
host in Inverness. A thane was to forfeit six cows
and a heifer; an "ochtyern", which is interpreted
as meaning "one equal in rank to a thane's son",
was liable to be mulcted in the amount of fifteen
sheep and 6<i>s.</i>, and a yeoman in that of a cow and
a sheep.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1318, under Robert Bruce, it was ordained
that, in time of war, every layman in the realm who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
had &pound;10 in goods, should have for his body, in the
defence of the country, a sufficient acton&mdash;a kind
of padded and quilted coat, which protected not
only the breast but the lower part of the body also;
a bascinet or light unvizored helmet; and gloves
of plate, with a spear and a sword. The acton and
bascinet might, however, be replaced by an habergeon
and "a hat of iron". Whoever failed to
comply with the requirements of the statute was to
forfeit all his goods, of which one-half was to go to
his immediate superior, the laird on whose lands he
dwelt, and the other half to the King. It was also
decreed that every man having in goods the value
of a cow should have a stout spear or a serviceable
bow, with a sheaf of twenty-four arrows. In the
same year another Act ordained that men on their
way to join the army should pay for what they took,
but enjoined, at the same time, that they should be
supplied at moderate rates.</p>

<p class="indent">When James I returned from his captivity in
England, he lost no time in putting into practice
the lesson which he had learnt there as to the
efficiency of the bow. Amongst the enactments of
his first Parliament there was one which ordained
that every male person should, from his twelfth
year, busk himself to be an archer; that, near every
parish church, "bow marks should be made, at
which, on holidays, men might come and shoot, at
least thrice about", and have usage of archery; and
that whoever did not use the said archery, the laird
of the land or the sheriff should raise of him a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
wedder.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
This was in 1424. In the same year it
was also enacted that, in every sheriffdom, four
musters should be held every year for the inspection
of arms.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Following closely upon this, there were issued
supplementary instructions of a somewhat more
comprehensive nature than hitherto. Gentlemen
having &pound;10 worth of land, or more, were to provide
themselves with a bascinet with whole legharness,
that is to say, complete coverings which
came up to the hips, and with spear, sword, and
dagger. Gentlemen owning less land, or no land
at all, were to be accoutred "at their goodly power",
subject to the oversight and discretion of the sheriff.
Honest yeomen, "having sufficient power", and
willing to serve as men-at-arms, were to be "harnessed
sufficiently" to the satisfaction of the same
official; whilst all other yeomen in the realm,
within the statutory limits of age, that is, between
sixteen and sixty, were to be "sufficiently bowit
and schaffit", or, in other words, adequately equipped
with a good bow and a suitable supply of arrows,
and were also to have a sword, buckler, and knife.
All burgesses and indwellers in the burghs of the
realm were to be similarly armed. Failure to
attend the four wapenshaws involved fines ranging
from 40<i>s.</i> to &pound;10, according to the number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
absences, in the case of a gentleman; and from 10<i>s.</i>
to 40<i>s.</i> in that of a bowman.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Four years later, in 1429, "by the advice of the
whole Parliament", further modifications were made,
both in the outfit and in the valuation according to
which it was regulated. Every man who disposed
of a yearly rent of &pound;20, or who possessed &pound;100
in movable goods, was required to be well horsed
and "haill enarmyt", which meant completely
armed from head to foot, as a gentleman ought to
be. The man of lower standing, with no more than
&pound;10 of rent, or &pound;50 of movable goods, was to provide
himself with a gorget&mdash;a piece of armour which
protected the throat and upper part of the chest;
with rearbraces and vambraces, as the coverings for
the upper arm and the forearm were respectively
called; with gloves of plate, breastplate, leg-splints,
and knee-pieces, "at the least, or better, if he liked".
The yeomen were divided into three classes, of
which the highest, consisting of those whose property
amounted to &pound;20 in goods, was to be equipped
with a good "doublet of fence", an iron hat, bow
and sheaf of arrows, sword, buckler, and knife.
Yeomen possessing no more than &pound;10 in goods
formed the second class. They were required to
have a bow and arrows, sword, buckler, and knife;
but though no defensive armour was mentioned in
their case, it may be assumed that they were not
expected to be less protected than the yeoman of
the third class, who was no archer and could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
deal with a bow, but for whom a good "suir" hat
and a "doublet of fence" were prescribed, in
addition to a sword, a buckler, and a good axe,
or else a staff with a sharp iron point. Every
citizen having &pound;50 in goods was placed on the
same level as a gentleman, and was required to be
armed in the same manner as one. The burgess
of lower degree, whose property was not valued
at more than &pound;20, was to provide a "suir" hat
and doublet, an habergeon, sword, and buckler;
a bow with the necessary sheaf of arrows; and a
knife. Barons and bailies were required to see that
these enactments were duly complied with in their
respective districts, under certain pains and penalties
which the sheriff was empowered to impose.</p>

<p class="indent">During the fifteenth and the sixteenth century
there were several other Acts of Parliament and of
the Privy Council dealing with wapenshaws. It
may be gathered from the preambles to some of
them that these periodical inspections were occasionally
discontinued for years together; whilst the
repeated injunctions to the various local authorities
and officials to use their utmost diligence in enforcing
the law afford proof that the burden of
military service was irksome to those on whom it
fell. But the special interest of those enactments
lies in the information which they supply both as
to the variations in the assessment on which that
service was based and as to the changes which took
place in the outfit of the several classes of fighting men.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
In 1456 it was made obligatory on every man
whose goods amounted to 20 marks to be provided
at least with a jack having sleeves to the hands, or,
failing that, with a pair of "splints" encasing the
arms; with a sallet&mdash;a light helmet, of which the
characteristic feature was a projection behind&mdash;or
with a spiked hat; and with a sword, buckler, and
bow together with a sheaf of arrows. Such as could
not shoot were to be armed with an axe, and with
a targe either of leather or of deal, with two bands
on the back.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
In the following year steps were taken to organize a system of military training.
As a preliminary measure, golf and football were to be
"utterly cried down". "Bow marks" were to be
set up. The smaller parishes were not required to
have more than a pair of these butts; but, in the
larger, according to their size, there were to be
three, four, and even five. All the male inhabitants,
from twelve to fifty years of age, were expected
to practise every Sunday, and to shoot at
least six shots. Defaulters were liable to a fine
of not less than 2<i>d.</i>; and the money thus raised
was to be given to those who were more regular
in their attendance "to drink". This archery
practice was to be kept up from Easter to Allhallowmas.
As a necessary supplement to these
ordinances, every county town was to have a bowyer
and a fletcher, otherwise a maker of bows and a
maker of arrows, and was to furnish them "with
stuff and graith that they might serve the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
with".<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
But as Scotland was not self-sufficing in
the matter of either weapons or accoutrements, there
was a further enactment which required all merchants
of the realm passing over the sea for merchandise
to bring home at each voyage as they might
"goodly thole" harness and armours, spear-shafts
and bow staves "after the quantity of their merchandise".</p>

<p class="indent">No further Act of Parliament concerning the
equipment of the Scots fighting men was passed till
1471. In that year it was found necessary to fix
the length of the spear, or rather, to forbid either
the importation or the making of any that fell short
of the six ells that had always constituted the regulation
size. For those yeomen who could not
handle the bow, the substitution of a good axe and
a targe of leather was authorized, as it had been
in 1456. With regard to the latter, a suggestive
standard of toughness and strength was indicated.
It was to be sufficiently stout "to resist the shot
of England". And a characteristic remark concerning
it was, that it would entail "no cost but
the value of a hide".<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">There was practically no change in arms and
accoutrement during the fifteenth century; and an
Act passed in 1491 is almost verbally identical with
that of 1425. More than forty years were yet to
elapse before James V, realizing the advantage
which other nations had secured for themselves by
the adoption of "small artillery", and the consequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
necessity of providing himself with similar
"instruments of war and battle", caused an Act
to be passed with a view to bringing Scotland's
armament abreast of that "commonly used in all
countries both by sea and land". This was in
1535.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Hand-guns, or hand-cannon as they were called,
had been introduced into England in the year 1471,
when Edward IV, landing at Ravenspur, in Yorkshire,
brought with him, amongst other forces, three
hundred Flemings armed with those new weapons.
They are also said to have been used at the siege
of Berwick in 1521. These portable firearms soon
got to be known under the names of culverins and
hagbuts. The culverin was originally a small tube
of half or three-quarters of an inch internal diameter,
fixed to a straight piece of wood or welded
to an iron handle. The smallest were about four
feet long and weighed some fifteen pounds, and the
management of them was as complicated as the
weapons themselves were unwieldy. The culveriner
had, in addition to his cumbrous piece, "his coarse
powder, for loading, in a flask; his fine powder, for
priming, in a touch-box; his bullets in a leathern
bag, with strings to draw to get at them; whilst
in his hand were his musket rest and his burning
match". The hagbut was a smaller and improved
culverin. At their first introduction into Scotland
these firearms appear to have been used mainly for
purposes of sport; but it is suggestive of a lack of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
familiarity with them to find James V paying 40<i>s.</i>
to "Walter Cunynghame's wife in Stirling" for a
cow which he had slain with a culverin.</p>

<p class="indent">By the Act of 1535, which was repeated in 1540,
it was ordained that every landed man should have
a hagbut of cast-iron, called "hagbut of crochert",
together with the mould, bullets, and "pelloks" of
lead or iron, and with the powder convenient
thereto for every &pound;100 of land that he owned. He
that had but 100 marks of land was to supply two
culverins; whilst only one was required of the
smaller landowner whose valuation did not exceed
&pound;40. These pieces were to be furnished with all
the necessary accessories. Those who supplied the
weapons were also called upon to provide men, not
only to fire them, but also to teach others to do so.
Neither the clergy nor even women were exempted
from the general obligation; and the fine to be
imposed on all who neglected to comply with the
requirements of the Act was fixed at twice the price
that would buy "each piece of the said artillery".
As to the burghs, a commission was to be appointed
for the purpose of deciding in what proportion each
of them was to contribute. And, as a corollary to
this enactment, it was further ordained that, because
neither artillery nor harness could be furnished
nor made ready unless the same were imported
into the country, every merchant sailing
forth of the realm or exporting goods amounting to
a last, that is to twelve tons, should bring home two
hagbuts or more, in proportion to the quantity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
merchandise shipped, with powder and moulds, or
else as much metal as would make the hagbuts.</p>

<p class="indent">From another Act passed in the same year it
appears to have been anticipated that, in spite of
these ordinances, the number of men that could be
armed with hand-guns would be but slight as compared
with those who would still have to retain the
older weapons, for no alteration was prescribed in
the matter of defensive armour. This statute is
noteworthy, however, by reason of a paragraph
bearing the heading, "That the army of Scotland
be unhorsed, except great Barons".<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
It was introduced by a reference to the great hurt, scaith, and
damage done by the coming, in multitude, of horsemen,
through the destruction of cornfields and
meadows and the harrying of poor folk, and also
to the great impediment made by them in the host,
where all men had to fight on foot. It then went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
on to ordain that no manner of men should have
horses with them, but should be ready to march
on foot from the first meeting-place it might please
the King to assign. For the journey to that meeting-place,
however, the use of palfreys was authorized.
And if any man came on horseback, or
brought horses with him, he was to send them home
again immediately, but only with a riding-boy, and
not with anyone able to bear arms. The matter
was considered to be of such importance that no
less a penalty than death was to be imposed for disobedience
of the order. A proviso was, however,
added, excepting earls, lords, barons, and great
landed men from the operation of the Act.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a further clause to which also special
interest attaches from the fact that it supplies the
first evidence to be met with in Parliamentary records
of an attempt at organizing a system of military
drill. It ordained that a board consisting of
the local authorities, the most able persons in the
shire, and the commissioners appointed by the King,
should, in every parish, choose a suitable man for
each company levied within it, and should assign
to him the duties of Captain. It was to be his
special office to teach the men to march together
and to bear their weapons, so that they might be
"the more expert to put themselves in order hastily
and keep the same in time of need". The companies
were to muster for drill before noon on at
least two of the most suitable holidays during each
of the three summer months, and as often as could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
be conveniently arranged for during the other nine.</p>

<p class="indent">Such efforts were well meant; but perseverance,
the first of the conditions necessary to ensure their
success, appears to have been wanting. In 1546,
a special wapenshaw was ordered to be held on Low
Sunday, and the reason given for this step was, that
the lieges were out of use of armour and weapons
because such inspections had been neglected.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
The accoutrements mentioned as requiring to be produced
on this occasion were practically the same as formerly.
In so far as evidence can be found in Acts
of either Parliament or Privy Council, this was one
of the last occasions on which specific mention was
made of the armour and weapons to be borne by the
respective classes of fighting men. In the closing
years of the sixteenth century, however, the periodical
complaint of laxity in the performance of
military duties in time of peace again appears in an
Act which, besides appointing a general wapenshaw
to be held on the 1st of May, 1599, specifies the
arms with which persons of various ranks were to
be furnished, and thus affords material for an estimate
of the change which had taken place in the
equipment of the Scots forces, as well as on the
obligations which military service now entailed.
Earls, lords, barons, and gentlemen were to be
armed with corslet of proof, headpiece, vambraces,
teslets or coverings for the thighs, and a Spanish
pike. In addition to this, every earl was to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
twenty stands of similar armour for his household;
every lord, ten; and every baron, one, for every
15 chalders of corn. Every baron and gentleman
whose living did not depend upon "victual"<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
was to provide a complete stand for every 1000 marks
of his yearly rent; every gentleman worth 300 marks
in yearly rent was to be furnished with a light corslet
and pike, or else with a musket, together with
rest and bandoleer, and a headpiece. The regulation
was to extend to the burghs; and the local
authorities were to see that every burgess worth
&pound;500 of free gear should have a light corslet, a
pike and halbard, or a two-handed sword, or else
a musket, with its accessories, and a headpiece.
But they were also to arrange in such a way that,
for every light corslet and pike within the burgh,
there should be two muskets. The penalties with
which defaulters were threatened afford evidence
that, although the country was still far from rich, it
had made considerable progress since the days when
fines were levied in kind. They were graded as
follows: Every earl, 2000 marks; every lord, 1000
marks; every baron, for every 15 chalders of victual
that he could spend, 100 marks; and every other
person of the rank and substance indicated, &pound;40.</p>

<p class="indent">It was one thing to require all ranks, degrees, and
qualities to provide themselves with arms on this
liberal scale, but it was another to put it into the
power even of the most willing, to comply with the
order. As a subsequent Act frankly admitted, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
was "no such quantity of armour made within the
realm as anywise might furnish the lieges thereof",
and there consequently arose "a great necessity of
bringing of the same home, forth of other countries".
It was Sir Michael Balfour of Burleigh who, "not
upon any respect of gain and profit that he might
reap thereby, but upon the earnest affection and
great regard he had to his Majesty's service and to
the benefit of the realm", suggested a way out of
the difficulty. He undertook to bring home 10,000
stands of armour, of which 2000 were to be for
horsemen&mdash;figures which, in default of more precise
data, are of some assistance towards forming an estimate
of the military strength of the country.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Michael Balfour's offer was accepted; and the
conditions of the contract duly fixed. The outfit
for horsemen was to be complete in all pieces, and
was to be supplied in two qualities: lance and sword
proof, and hagbut proof. The former was to cost
&pound;50, and the latter &pound;10 more. A complete suit of
armour for a footman was to be charged &pound;18, and
was to be of one quality only&mdash;lance and sword
proof. The price of a hagbut, with flask or bandoleer,
was set at &pound;6, 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="indent">From the long list of defaulters that might be
made up from the records of the Privy Council, and
in which the names of all sorts and conditions of the
lieges, of earls and of yeomen alike, would figure
side by side, as well as from the legal proceedings
which were taken by Sir Michael Balfour, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
one hand, and, on the other, by those who, on
various grounds, claimed to be exempted from the
operation of the Act, it appears that there was but
little military enthusiasm in the country at this time.
And this is borne out by an Act of Privy Council
passed in July, 1607. It set forth that, notwithstanding
the Act of 1599 for general arming and
wapenshawing, there had been no inspection within
the kingdom for several years past, and that the
"lovable custom, which of old was very precisely
kept and was very necessary and expedient for the
good of the kingdom", had fallen into desuetude by
reason of the negligence of the sheriffs and other
officials; and it required these "to charge all and
sundry, by open proclamation at the market crosses
of the head burghs, to give and make their musters
and wapenshawing" on the 4th of the following
month. A few days later, however, the order was
prorogated, for no more urgent reason than the
meeting of Parliament; and with that, the periodical
inspection of arms appears to have been finally abandoned
for the remainder of the reign of James VI,
who, by this time, had become James I of England
also, a circumstance which goes far to explain the
general indifference on the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">The first and main object that was always kept in
view, and towards which Scotland's military dispositions
were directed, was the protection of the
country against the attacks of the "old enemy", as
England was repeatedly styled. In more than one
of the ordinances it was expressly set forth, that all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
manner of men were to hold themselves in readiness
"to come to the Border for the defence of the land
when any wittering came of the incoming of a great
English host". And if the ever-present danger
assumed more definite form and an invasion was
actually expected, letters were sent throughout the
country, charging all the lieges to be prepared to
take the field in all possible haste, well equipped and
duly supplied with provisions for a fixed number of
days, usually forty, as soon as they were summoned.
Warning of the approach of an invading army was
signalled round the country by means of bale-fires
which were lighted on certain specified hills.</p>

<p class="indent">For the purpose of defraying the expenses entailed
by a campaign, recourse was had to extraordinary
taxation. In 1550, for instance, the Privy
Council ordained that "for resisting of our auld
ynemyis of Ingland, the defence of the West
Borders, and the repairing of a fort of strength in
the town of Annan, the sum of &pound;4000 should be
raised and uplifted of the prelates and clergy of the
realm. If the amount were "thankfullie payit and
debursit", exemption from further taxation for the
next year was promised.</p>

<p class="indent">To meet the requirements of the transport service,
certain districts were laid under requisition.
Thus, for the same campaign, the sheriffs of Edinburgh
principal, Edinburgh lying within the constabulary
of Haddington, Selkirk, and Lauderdale,
were called upon to assist and concur with the
Lairds of Lethington, Whittingham, Elphinstone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Trabroun, and Wauchton, in devising measures for
furnishing the oxen and pioneers required for the
forthbringing of the munition and artillery to the
host and army which was to assemble in Edinburgh.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not solely for the defence of their own
country that Scotsmen were obliged to bear arms.
Occasion might arise when, in conformity with the
"old leagues, bands, amity and alliance" which were
supposed to have been entered upon by King Achaus
and the Emperor Charlemagne, and to have been
renewed and confirmed by every king and prince
since that time, Scotland was obliged to furnish a
contingent for the support of the Most Christian
King. Such was the case in 1552. In the month
of November of that year, the Regent Arran and
the Lords of the Secret Council ordained that every
40-mark land, whether it were royal, temporal, or
spiritual, should supply "one able, sufficient footman,
well furnished, clad in new hose and a new
doublet of canvas at the least, with a jack of plate,
steel bonnet, splint sleeves of mail or plate, with a
spear of six ells long or thereby". Every burgh
within the realm was to provide a company consisting
of 300 men, who were, as far as possible, to be
hagbutters, furnished with powder flask, morsing
horn, and all other gear belonging thereto. Two
further companies of footmen were likewise to be
raised in the highland parts of the realm, within the
bounds of Lord Huntly's lieutenancy. Horsemen
to the number of 400, each having "ane dowbill
horse", were to be supplied by the bishops, abbots,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
priors, and prelates, earls, lords, and barons of the
Borders and Lowlands. Gilbert, Earl of Cassillis, was
appointed Lieutenant-General of the army, and Patrick,
Lord Ruthven, Colonel of the footmen. The subordinate
officers numbered fifty-five. The expense of the
expedition was to be borne by the King of France.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">It was not only when Scotland was engaged in
actual warfare, either on her own account or as the
ally of France, that she required to call out her
fighting men. The state of the country was such
that the "fencibles" of some district might, at any
moment, be required to take the field. Within less
than a decade&mdash;between 1569 and 1578&mdash;there
were at least twelve local levies. The first and five
others of them, that is to say, a full half of the
whole number, were raised for purposes similar to
those indicated by an Act of Privy Council, in
September, 1569, "to pass forthward for pursuit
and invasion of the thieves, traitors, and rebellious
subjects, inhabitants of the bounds of the Middle
and West Wardencies". For such an expedition as
that, there were called out "all and sundry his
Majesty's lieges betwixt 40 and 16 years, and other
fencible persons" dwelling in 12 sheriffdoms, 2
stewartries, and 3 bailliries. And they were required
to assemble, not only "weill bodin in feir
of weir"&mdash;the current phrase for complete fighting
equipment&mdash;but also to bring with them twenty days'
victuals and provisions, and to provide themselves
with tents to lie in the fields.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
As it was impossible for every man to carry with
him twenty days' provisions otherwise than in the
shape of money wherewith to buy them, a commissariat
of some kind became a matter of necessity.
To provide it, the inhabitants of some town might
be required, as was the case with those of Glasgow,
in 1572, "to follow the army where it shall repair,
with bread, ale, and all other kinds of vivers for
men and horse, which shall be bought from them
with ready money and thankful payment". If circumstances
made it more convenient, a number of
burghs, towns, and other places where "hostelry
was used" were informed beforehand, by public
proclamation, that they would have to "prepare
and have in readiness, baked bread, brewed ale,
wine, and all other manner of horse meat and men's
meat, and address them to transport and carry the
same, by land or sea, to the camp, where it shall
happen to be, there to be sold upon sufficient and
good prices". If, as might be the case in the
"countries most ewest of the Borders", lochs or
rivers should have to be crossed or otherwise utilized
for the purpose of the expedition, commandment
and direction was given to all and sundry
owners, masters, and skippers of ships, barks, "birlingis",
boats, and other vessels meet for ferrying,
to have their craft prepared and in full readiness to
receive, carry, and transport men, munition, horses,
victuals, or other warlike provisions to such place
as should be specially appointed. For disobedience
to any of the orders issued for the purpose of levying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
an expeditionary force or of furthering its movements
and operations, the penalty to be imposed
was always the same, "forfeiture of life, lands, and
goods".</p>

<p class="indent">The last phase in the development of the old
Scots army began at the death of James VI. Shortly
after the accession of his successor, the Estates issued
a proclamation which had for its object the revival
of "that lovable custom of wapenshawings" which
"the laziness of the people themselves", but "specially
the sloth and careless negligence" of the
magistrates whose office it was to make arrangements
for those inspections, had allowed to lapse.
And the reason given for this renewal of interest in
the ancient institution was contained in a reference
to the "universal combustion and bruittis, and
rumours of foreign preparation throughout Christendom".
But nothing more practical was yet to
come of it than an order for the holding of a muster.
Nearly twenty years were to elapse before the same
Estates were moved to give "their most serious
consideration" to the reorganization of the national
forces. This had become necessary by reason of
"the great and imminent danger of the true Protestant
religion and of the peace of the kingdom
from the treacherous and bloodie plots, conspiracies,
attempts, and practices of papists, prelates, malignants,
and their adherents". In order to put the
kingdom, with all possible speed, in a posture of
defence, order was given that all fencible persons
within sixty and sixteen years of age, should provide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
themselves with forty days' provisions of all sorts, in
the most substantious manner, for horse and foot,
with tents and all other furnishing requisite; that
horsemen should be armed with pistols, broadswords,
and steel caps; that where those arms could not be
had, jacks or secrets, lances, and steel bonnets, and
swords should be substituted for them. Footmen
were to be armed with musket and sword, or pike
and sword; but, failing these, they were to be furnished
with halbards, Lochaber axes, or Jedburgh
staffs, and swords. Colonels of horse and foot, and
Committees of War were appointed in each sheriffdom,
and were enjoined to form "their whole fencible
persons into regiments, foot companies, and
horse troops". The men were to be "drilled and
exercised in managing their arms&mdash;every regiment
once in the month, every company and troop once
in the week". The captains of each company were
to be provided with colours and drums, and the
"rootmasters", or captains of horse, with trumpets
and cornets. For the purpose of enforcing this Act,
another was passed in the following year, again requiring
all to arm, under a penalty of &pound;20 to be
paid by those who, being in a position to buy a
musket and sword, should yet be found unprovided
with them. Those who, though able to purchase a
pike, neglected to do so, were to be fined 10 marks.
Yeomen or servants lacking the means to provide
themselves with the weapons prescribed by the Act
were to be equipped by their respective heritors or
masters. Further, the Committees of War in each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
shire were called upon to acquire and store, two
pounds weight of powder and four pounds weight
of match and ball, for every fencible person within
their district.</p>

<p class="indent">It was at this time, too, that the first Act dealing
with desertion from the army was passed. It gave
strict injunctions to the Colonels and Committees of
War to apprehend all those, both of horse and foot,
who ran away from their colours, and empowered
them, if they thought it expedient for the good of
the army, to "decimate the fugitives, and cause
hang the tenth man". If there were less than ten
offenders, one might still be put to death, "for
terrifying others"; and if there were only one, he
might be made to suffer the extreme penalty.</p>

<p class="indent">Milder legislation originated at this time, too. It
was in 1645 that an Act "in favour of lamed soldiers"
promised maintenance upon the public charges
to all who were so hurt and wounded in the defence
of the public cause as to be unfit for their ordinary
employment; and that another appointed a Committee
to devise measures for the relief of the widows
and orphans of those who fell. And so anxious
were the Estates that their good faith should not
be doubted, that they pledged the honour of the
kingdom in proof of it.</p>

<p class="indent">From this point, the story of the Scots army
merges into that of the civil wars of the period.
And to relate it further would be to recapitulate
what general histories of Scotland have already made
more or less familiar to all.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF THE<br />"LONG-TAIL" MYTH</h2>

<p class="indent">The 17th of December, 1566, was the christening
day of Mary Stuart's infant son. Amongst the
festivities arranged in celebration of the event, there
was a "great banquet", to which the representatives
of foreign sovereigns had been invited, and at
which a foremost place had been assigned to Hatton
and the Englishmen who had accompanied him to
Scotland. To enliven the entertainment, George
Buchanan had written a masque, in which the
actors were satyrs who, whilst reciting his complimentary
verses, were to bring various symbolical
gifts to the royal infant. The performance of this
interlude had been entrusted to a Frenchman named
Bastien. As the meat was being brought through
the great hall, on a "trim engine", that seemed to
move of itself, he made his appearance with a band
of men disguised to represent the mythological
monsters, and wearing long tails, in keeping with
their assumed character. But he and his associates
"were not content only to red roun". Whether
merely acting on a mischievous impulse or deliberately
carrying out a preconcerted joke, the mummers,
as they passed near the English guests, put their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
hands to their tails and began wagging them.
Hatton and his party "daftly apprehending that
which they should not seem to have understood",
and placing the worst construction on the silly and
unseemly trick, chose to believe that it had been
planned in derision of them and out of spiteful
jealousy "that the Queen made more of them than
of the Frenchmen". To mark their sense of the
insult offered them, "they all set down upon the
bare floor behind the back of the board, that they
should not see themselves scorned, as they thought".
In relating the incident to Sir James Melville, who
records it in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, Hatton added that, if it
had not taken place in the Royal palace and in

<p class="indent">Coarse and unmannerly as was the satyrs' by-play,
it would hardly seem to have deserved to be
taken so seriously and so ill by the English guests,
if it were not remembered that it expressed in dumb
show what had for centuries been looked upon by
Englishmen as a deadly insult&mdash;a reference to the
popular belief that they were distinguished from the
natives of other countries by the physical monstrosity
of bearing tails. That this was accepted as an actual
and disgraceful fact there is abundant evidence to
prove. In a medieval Latin poem<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
devoted to an enumeration of the distinctive characteristics of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
various nations of Europe, the unflattering lines that
fall to the share of the English, jeer at them for this
deformity, whilst not omitting to denounce the
treachery so commonly and so spitefully attributed
to them by their enemies:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A brute beast is the Englishman,</span>
<span class="i2">For he doth bear a tail;</span>
<span class="i0">Beware, and treat him as a foe,</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">The anonymous satirist, however, was not original.
He had not the merit, such as it might be,
of having invented the slander which he flung as
an insult at the people against whom he obviously
entertained a bitter animosity. If, as there is reason
to believe, he was a Frenchman, he merely repeated
a gibe which had long been one of the commonplaces
of vulgar vituperation amongst his compatriots.
In the description which the thirteenth-century
chronicler, Jacques de Vitry, gives of the
depraved state of Paris in his day, and more particularly
of the rude behaviour and coarse jests of the
students who flocked to its famous university, he
states that diversity of nationality aroused amongst
them dissensions, hatred and violent animosities, to
which they gave vent by indulging in all kinds of
invectives against each other. As an example of
their scurrility, he mentions that they called the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
English drunkards and "tailards".<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
To suppose, from the very absurdity of the imputation, that it
was merely cast as a taunt, and that no actual belief
lay behind it, would be to ignore all that medieval
credulity was capable of. Moreover, the attitude
taken up by the English themselves, implied shame
at an alleged deformity fully as much as anger at a
wanton insult. On this point evidence is supplied
by the Dominican monk Etienne de Bourbon, a
moralist who flourished about the middle of the
thirteenth century. In a treatise which is devoted
to the exposition of subjects suitable for the pulpit,
and which abounds in quaint stories as well as in
caustic commentaries on contemporary manners, he
does not omit to deal with the inordinate love of
dress displayed by women, and to denounce the
prevailing fashion of wearing extravagantly long
trains to their gowns. He rebukes them for impiously
presuming to better God's work, for doing
away with the honourable distinction conferred upon
them as human beings, and for deliberately assuming
that which brings them down to the same level as
brute beasts. As a climax, he inveighs against their
shamelessness in making themselves what the English
blush to be called&mdash;"tailards".<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
The events that were chiefly instrumental in
bringing the English into either contact or conflict
with Continental nations, during the Middle Ages,
were the Crusades and the Hundred Years' War.
The chronicles that deal with these are not wanting
in instances from which it may be gathered how
readily the obnoxious gibe came to the lips of those
that wished to show their contempt for the islanders.
Richard of Devizes, who wrote one of the earliest
and most authentic narratives of the reign of
Richard I, with whom he was contemporary, describes
how, in 1190, the inhabitants of Messina
manifested their hatred for the strangers whom the
King had brought to their shores, and how they
tried to wreak vengeance on him and his "tailards";
for, explains the chronicler, the Greeks and the
Sicilians gave the name of "tailards" to all who
followed the English monarch.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Another very early reference to the use of the
term "tailard" as an opprobrious synonym for
"Englishmen" is that which occurs in a metrical
romance dealing with the same period and also recording,
but with poetical freedom, the life and
exploits of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion. The exact date
of the poem is unknown; but the fact of its being
mentioned in the <cite>Chronicles</cite> of Richard of Gloucester
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and in those of Robert de Brunne, supplies evidence
of its having been written earlier than the year 1300.
It is confessedly a translation from the French; and
that may account for the appearance in it of an insulting
epithet which an English writer might have
hesitated to use, even as an invective in the mouth
of an enemy. The Second Book of this romance
is devoted to a journey to the Holy Land, which
the English King is supposed to have undertaken
prior to the actual crusade, but which is, however,
made to include the well-known incident of his
capture. The poet tells how, when returning from
Palestine, with "Sir Foulke Doyly of renown, and
Sir Thomas of Multoun", Richard was betrayed,
captured, and brought as a prisoner before the King
of Allemayne; and how, when he represented himself
and his companions as pilgrims,</p>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">In the Sixth Book of the same poem, it is related
how the English King, on his way to Acre, put in at
Cyprus and sent messengers to the Emperor, and
how that monarch "began to rage", threw a knife
at one of them, and followed this up by peremptorily
ordering them out of his presence, with the
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="indent">There is a further account of Richard's journey
to the Holy Land in a poem by a writer of whom
we know that his name was Ambrose, and that he
witnessed various historical events between 1188
and 1196. It would also appear from his narrative
that he actually accompanied the Crusaders on the
expedition which he records. He, too, refers to
the hostile attitude assumed by the inhabitants of
Messina towards the English King's followers, and
states that they jeered at the foreigners and called
them "foul dogs", an epithet which, in the light
of the parallel texts, may be looked upon as an
allusion to the tails which the English were commonly
believed to bear.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
At the beginning of the thirteenth century, there
is an instance of the use of the offensive gibe which
shows to what purpose it was beginning to be turned
by the literate class of the day. During the minority
of Henry III, Louis VIII, continuing the aggressive
policy inaugurated by his father, Philip Augustus,
against the incapable administration of King John,
made a vigorous effort to wrest Poitou from the
English. Amongst the most noteworthy achievements
of this campaign, was the capture of La
Rochelle, in 1224. In celebration of this event,
a poetaster of the day wrote some doggerel
verses, which the <cite>Chronicle of Lanercost</cite><a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
has preserved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis our own native King, 'tis a stranger no more,</span>
<span class="i0">Who reigns in Rochelle, by the fortune of war;</span>
<span class="i0">And the fear of the English no longer prevails,</span>
<span class="i0">For he's made them all harmless by breaking their tails.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">On the other side, however, it was not forgotten
that, a few years earlier, in 1217, the same Louis,
after being deserted by the discontented barons who
had called him over, had suffered a crushing defeat
at Lincoln. This supplied fair material for a retort
in the same style:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">We have dragged our French foes,</span>
<span class="i4">Strung like larks in long rows,</span>
<span class="i0">And made fast to our tails with a rope;</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">The circumstances in which we next hear the
contemptuous appellation of "tailards" applied to
the English are particularly dramatic. It is in the
course of the seventh crusade, that which was undertaken,
in 1248, by Louis IX with an English contingent,
and of which Matthew of Paris is one of
the chroniclers. This time, however, it is not from
the enemy that the insult comes. It is from an
impetuous and overbearing ally, from the French
King's brother, Count Robert of Artois. The Count
was jealous of William Longsword; and on one
occasion, when the leader of the English was returning
from a successful but unauthorized raid,
he was arbitrarily deprived by his arrogant rival
of the booty which he was bringing back to the
camp. Having in vain appealed to Louis, who
appears to have been quite powerless against his
brother's presumption, the English chief retired to
Acre, with his two hundred knights; and the news
of their departure drew from Artois the scornful
exclamation that the army of the noble French was
well purged of those "tailards".<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
Longsword was ultimately prevailed upon by the king to return;
but it was not long before he had again to bear the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
brunt of Artois' overweening pride and insolence.
A difference of opinion had arisen between the rash
and headstrong Count and the more cautious Master
of the Templars, as to the advisability of following
up a successful attack that had just been made on
the infidels. Longsword was present and attempted
to intervene as a peacemaker between the disputants;
but he only succeeded in drawing on himself the
anger of the hot-headed Frenchman, who put a
climax to his violent invectives by insultingly referring
to the pusillanimity of the timid "tailards",
and expressing a wish that the army might, once
for all, be purged of tails and "tailards".<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
Even the dignified self-possession of Longsword was not
proof against such jeers. "Count Robert," he
replied, "I shall certainly proceed, undismayed by
any peril of impending death. We shall, I fancy,
be to-day where you will not dare to touch my
horse's tail."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
In the engagement thus recklessly
forced on&mdash;it was the battle of Mansourah&mdash;both
Artois and Longsword perished. But whilst the
French prince lost his life when trying to swim his
horse across a river, after ignominiously turning
tail,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
the English knight fell fighting valiantly with
his face to the overwhelming foe.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
The chronicles which record the events that
marked the closing years of the thirteenth century
supply a grim illustration of the ignominious treatment
which their reputation as "tailards" sometimes
brought upon the English. The war which
broke out about this time between Edward I and
Philip IV of France had for its cause, or, perhaps
more correctly, for its pretext, one of the brawls
which frequently arose when the sailors of the two
countries met in the ports on either side of the
Channel. Whether rightly or wrongly, the Frenchmen
represented the English as the aggressors.
They brought the matter under the notice of their
own king, and represented it as an insult to him
and to the whole nation that they should have been
so wantonly ill-used by the "tailards". In the
reprisals which followed, Philip's brother, Charles,
took a conspicuous part. Having a previous and
personal grievance against the English, he vented
his spite even on unoffending pilgrims and students.
He hanged several of the poor wretches who fell
into his hands; and, adding insult to injury, strung
up dogs side by side with them, to intimate, says
the <cite>Chronicle of Lanercost</cite>, the resemblance which
he thought to exist between the two, or, as another
record even more plainly puts it, to show that he
made no difference between a dog and an Englishman.
Amongst the State Papers relative to the
history of Edward I, there is a document which
very strikingly confirms the truth of this barbarous
incident. It consists of a long roll containing an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
account of the various outrages committed by the
French on English mariners and on inhabitants of the
Cinque Ports. One of the charges brought against
the Norman seamen is illustrated in the margin by a
contemporaneous sketch representing a row of Englishmen
hanging up, with a dog between each two.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">It is suggestive of the annoyance which the
English felt at their opprobrious nickname that,
when we find their writers noticing it, it is almost
invariably under provocation and in a tone of indignant
protest. One noteworthy exception to this
is to be met with in a curious, half-literary, half-historical
production, attributed to John of Bridlington.
It is a political retrospect of the reign of
Edward III, and consists of a supposed ancient text,
in Latin verse, with a recent commentary on it.
The poem itself purports to be a prophecy, whilst
the notes indicate in what manner the predictions
were fulfilled. As the leading event for the year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
1356, the date of the battle of Poitiers, it is foretold
that,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The four cockrels shall learn what defeat is, that day</span>
<span class="i0">When the French meet the English in battle array,</span>
<span class="i0">And the big-buttocked bullies are shamefully routed</span>
<span class="i0">By the men whom as 'tailards' their ribaldry flouted".<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The imaginary scholiast explains the meaning of
this to be, that the brood of the Gallic cock, or, in
other words, the French, will be vanquished by the
English, whom they jeeringly call "tailards"; that
the appellation which is here applied to them and
which has been somewhat euphemistically translated
by "big-buttocked", is intended as a set-off against
the ignominious term by which they commonly
designate the English; and that the four cockrels
especially referred to, are the king and his three
sons. "And, indeed, these four," it is added,
"were actually vanquished in that battle, the King
himself being captured with one of his sons, whilst
the other two fled from the field."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p class="indent">After Poitiers, the invasion of France by Henry
V is chronologically the next important event in
the long medieval struggle between England and
France. The initial success of the English, whilst
embittering the animosity of their enemies, inspired
a restraining respect; and there is an expression of
those mingled feelings of aversion and of fear in
the lines which a poetaster of the day addressed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the invaders, partly as a reproach, partly as an
appeal:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Perfidious race that perjured England breeds,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose evil nature shows in all your deeds,</span>
<span class="i0">Why must you still, with baneful purpose, seek</span>
<span class="i0">Your spite on righteous Frenchmen thus to wreak?</span>
<span class="i0">Christ's servants they, and constant to the faith</span>
<span class="i0">Which twice from you has suffered wanton scathe;</span>
<span class="i0">Your words are fair, but yet in all you do,</span>
<span class="i0">The crooked paths of falsehood you pursue;</span>
<span class="i0">Cut off that poisonous tail you long have worn,</span>
<span class="i0">A byword to the nations, and their scorn!</span>
<span class="i0">For thee, their king, be not my warning vain,</span>
<span class="i0">And, in thy mem'ry let this truth remain:</span>
<span class="i0">That God who willed thou shouldst a 'tailard' be</span>
<span class="i0">Has not denied his hallowing grace to thee."<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">But the fortune of war began to turn against the
English on the death of Henry V in 1422; and the
exultation caused by that event is voiced by Olivier
Basselin, in one of his popular poems:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The King who sat upon the English throne</span>
<span class="i0">The crown of France claimed also for his own;</span>
<span class="i0">He strove to drive as outcasts from their land</span>

<span class="i0">But, when death dashed the sceptre from his hand,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The alien host was scattered far and wide,</span>
<span class="i0">And France is now from English 'tailards' freed;</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">A few years later, possibly about 1430, a popular
ballade, in which an unknown writer celebrated the
exploits of Jeanne d'Arc, opened with a repetition of
the old insult:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Back, English 'tailards', back!"<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></span>

<p>And Enguerrand de Monstrelet, the Burgundian
chronicler of the events that marked the latter
half of the Hundred Years' War, records another
historical occasion on which the French gave utterance
to their triumph in the traditional gibe at the
alleged monstrosity of their old enemies. In his
account of the evacuation of Paris, in 1436, he
relates that, as the English retired from the city
which they had held for sixteen years, the inhabitants
hooted them with great cries of "Tails!"<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Coming down to the sixteenth century, we find
that, in the early years of it, when hostilities broke
out between Louis XII and Henry VIII, the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
insult fell readily from the pen of the French versifiers
who found subjects for their rhymes in the
military incidents of the time. Thus, in the <cite>D&eacute;pucellage
de la ville de Tournay</cite>, the town, referring
to its ill-advised refusal of help when the English
laid siege to it, is made to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To guard my ramparts from the foe's attack</span>
<span class="i0">A ready offer from the King was brought;</span>
<span class="i0">But, I refused, and sent the answer back:</span>
<span class="i0">'With men for watch and ward, no means I lack</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">But pride went before a fall. Tournay was occupied
by the English in 1513.</p>

<p class="indent">In Anatole de Montaiglon's collection of fifteenth
and sixteenth century verse, there is a poem which
bears the title of <cite>Courroux de la Mort contre les Anglois</cite>,
and which is in substance a bitter invective against
the English generally. It is undated; but an allusion
to the porcupine, the well-known emblem of
Louis XII, points to its having also been written at
this same period. In an apostrophe, the poet promises
his countrymen an easy victory over the
English:&mdash;</p>

The fight of Guinegate, commonly known as the
battle of the Spurs, can hardly have been looked
upon by him as a fulfilment of his prophecy. It
may rather, if that were still possible, have increased
the animosity which inspired the two scurrilous lines
in which he strung together as many opprobrious
epithets as the measure of his verse would admit,
and which duly included the traditional slander,
linked, in this instance, with the equally popular
nickname of "godon", supposed to have originated
in the frequent and profane use which the English
made of God's name:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="indent">So far, the use of the abusive term "tailard", in
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cou&eacute;</i> and in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caudatus</i>, has been traced
in immediate connection with events that brought
the English into direct conflict with their enemies.
There are not wanting instances, however, to show
that no special provocation was required, and that
from century to century it currently served the purpose
of those whom national antipathy prompted to
revile the English, or to hold them up to ridicule.
To begin with Eustache Deschamps, the most prolific
and versatile versifier of the late fourteenth and
the early fifteenth centuries, we find him giving
Englishmen and their tails a conspicuous place in
his satirical verses. In a poem of which only a
fragment remains, he describes how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They swagger grandly down the street,</span>
<span class="i0">An awsome sight to all they meet";</span>
</div></div>

<p>but how, in order not to mar the effect of the imposing
appearance which they assume,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Between their legs they hide with care</span>
<span class="i0">The tail which rumour says they wear".<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Englishmen's tails also supply the subject of
a rondeau in which Deschamps mockingly compares
the strength of the French with that of the English,
ironically proclaiming the superiority of the latter
as proved by the greater mass of flesh they have
to carry, and the additional appendage they are
obliged to drag about with them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The English are more stout, 'tis clear,</span>

In addition to this, Deschamps has a satirical
ballade, in which he again drags in the English by
the tail, professing concern for the inconvenience
which it must cause them, and earnestly advising
them to hold it up. "Billy", the predecessor of John
Bull, as a typical Englishman, opens the poem with
a gibe at the "French dogs", who "do nothing but
drink wine". "Frenchy" does not deny the soft
impeachment, but retorts that he considers it better
to indulge in the juice of the grape than to swill
beer. Then, by an abrupt transition and, if with
rhyme, without any special reason, he compares red-haired
Englishmen to mastiffs. On the strength of
that canine similitude, he impresses upon them the
necessity for holding up their tails. He commiserates
them on the additional burden which they have to
carry, though not endowed with the physical vigour
of Jacques Thommelin, the strong man of the day.
He warns them against walking abroad in dirty
weather; and if, in spite of the rain, they must
take their corn to the mill or gather grapes in the
vineyard, he bids them imitate their four-footed
neighbours the dogs, and hold up their tails to
prevent their trailing in the mud. The satire is
not keen, nor is the humour brilliant; and the whole
point lies in the rather scurrilous than apt refrain:

<p class="indent">Another ballade records an incident which is supposed
to have happened in Calais. In company with
Granson, a mercenary captain in English pay, but
without the necessary safe-conduct, the poet entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the town, which was then in possession of the
English. He was at once pulled up by two men-at-arms
who addressed him in language of which
he quotes such scraps as "dogue" and "goday",
"ride" and "commidre". He, on his side, intimated
his recognition of their nationality by exclaiming:
"Oh yes! I see your tail!" Whilst Granson,
who had led him into the trap, made off laughing
and calling out that he had no wish to stand surety
for him, Deschamps was told that he would be kept
in durance, an announcement which again drew from
him the taunt, "Oil, je voy vo queue!" Though
confessedly blue with fright, he nevertheless summoned
up enough courage to make a dash for
liberty. Digging his heels vigorously into his cob,
he made it rear with a suddenness that sent his
captors sprawling; and whilst they lay helplessly on
the ground, he hastily betook himself out of their
reach, uttering the inevitable refrain:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Another writer of the same period, Olivier Basselin,

In one of his minor poems, Jean Molinet, part-author
of the <cite>Roman de la Rose</cite>, who also belongs
to the fifteenth century, humorously goes one step
further than his fellow satirists, and gives even
animals of English race a share in the distinctive
peculiarity which birth in England entailed on the
human Islanders. Of a certain tom-cat he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This Cat for his mother had Cathau the Blue,</span>

<p class="indent">About the beginning of the sixteenth century,
Cr&eacute;tin, a Norman poet, combines encouragement of
the French with the usual abuse of the English:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Praise shall reward the doughty deeds you do,</span>
<span class="i0">And store of crowns, and golden angels, too;</span>
<span class="i0">And, in the ransom of the 'long-tailed' crew,</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">As late as the seventeenth century, an echo of the
gibe may still be heard. Larivey, in one of his
comedies, <cite>Les Tromperies</cite>, makes a swaggering captain
boast of the reputation which he has acquired
by valiantly charging the English "tailards" when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
they attempted to land at Dieppe.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
Still nearer our own day, Saint-Amant, who, indeed, is so modern
that he was one of the original members of the
French Academy and figures in Boileau's satires,
has a reference to the English longtails in his <cite>Rome
Ridicule</cite>. He incidentally claims for the French the
strange merit of having rid their country of the
goitre and of the king's evil by making carrion of
the English invaders:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The goitre now we never see,</span>
<span class="i0">And cruels, too, have ceased to be,</span>
<span class="i0">E'er since we slew our 'tailard' foes</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">By this time, however, the tradition had ceased to
be popular; for in a note on this passage, Saint-Amant's
contemporary, Conrart, thought it necessary
to give an explanation of the epithet "quouez".
According to him, it was justified by the fact that,
in the case of the majority of Englishmen, the end
of the os sacrum, called <em>coccyx</em>, actually protrudes
and forms a tail!<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
But, even yet, the old cry has not wholly died
out. In the Island of Guernsey, that genuine bit of
Normandy, where it was once so frequently heard, it
is perpetuated by the country children. They have
a custom of slyly throwing at passers-by a hairy,
clinging weed, which grows abundantly by the wayside.
If any of it catches on to the victims of their
childish trick, these are made aware of it by hearing
themselves jeered at with cries of "la Coue!" The
words are the very same as those recorded by
Monstrelet; and this identity seems to justify the
belief that they are a survival of the medieval scoff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent">The Scots, sharing as they did the feeling of animosity
entertained by the French against their English
foes, were no less ready than they to give it expression;
and the insulting taunt which they had learnt from
their continental allies was adopted as an effective
means to that end. It is not, however, amidst the
excitement of international strife that the cry is first
heard. The earliest instance of its use in the North
Country is given by Bower. Under the date of
1217, he has an account of the mission to Scotland,
undertaken by the Prior of Durham and the Archdeacon
of York, in connection with the interdict
under which the kingdom had been laid. These
two prelates made themselves very unpopular by
the mercenary spirit which they displayed; and a
monkish satirist voiced the irritation which they
aroused, in a strongly worded Latin poem, containing
amongst other terms of reproach and invective,
a denunciation of them as "tailards":
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Those clerics, both in treach'rous England born,</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">As regards the other instances supplied by the
chroniclers, it is noteworthy that the insult was, in
each case, avenged by the defeat of those who flung
it at their enemies. The first occasion on which
this is reported to have occurred was the battle of
Dunbar, in 1296. The Castle, at that time one of
the most important in Scotland, had been delivered
over to the Scottish leaders by the Countess of
Dunbar. Edward I at once sent John Plantagenet,
Earl of Warrenne and Surrey, to recapture it. The
garrison, conscious of its inability to hold out against
the ten thousand foot and the thousand heavy-armed
horse which the English leader commanded, agreed
to surrender to him if it were not relieved within
three days. In the meantime, John Baliol, anxious
to retain so important a stronghold, sent his whole
army of forty thousand foot and fifteen hundred
horse to its succour. When the besieged saw this
formidable force encamped on the heights above
Spot, they felt confident of success; and in their premature
exultation, they jeered at the English, calling
them "tailed dogs", and threatening not only to
kill them, but also to cut off their tails. Their
boasts were not justified by the result. In the engagement
that followed, the rashness of the Scots in
abandoning their favourable position proved disastrous.
Ten thousand of them fell on the field or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
during the pursuit; and next day the Castle surrendered
at discretion to Edward, who came up from
Berwick with the remainder of his army.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>

<p class="indent">In the following year, Lord Robert Clifford made
an incursion into Annandale, at the head of twenty
thousand infantry, preceded by a body of only one
hundred cavalry. On passing the Solway, it was
proclaimed by sound of trumpet that every soldier
might plunder for himself and keep his own booty.
On hearing this welcome announcement, the infantry
dispersed over the country, and the horse alone
remained together and marched on Annan, where
the Scots, thinking they had to do with a mere
handful, received them with jeers and insults, as a
pack of "tailed" dogs. But when it came to actual
fighting, the heavy-armed cavalry proved too much
for the dalesmen. They were driven into marshy
ground, where they were easily overpowered by the
infantry that had hurried up to reinforce the vanguard.
Over three hundred of the Scots were slain,
many prisoners were taken; and before the Englishmen
returned to Carlisle with their booty, the destruction
of ten villages had given the scoffers
good reason to think less contemptuously of the
"tailards".<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>

At least once again the ill-omened cry was heard.
It was on the eve of the battle of Dupplin, which
was fought on the 12th of August, 1332, between
Edward Baliol, with his English supporters, and the
army of David II, under the Earl of Mar. Trusting
to their superior numbers and to their advantageous
position, the Scots were confident of success.
They spent a part of the night in drinking and in
singing songs that contained insulting reference to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The English 'tailards', jeered at for their tails",</span>
</div></div>

<p>and they bragged that they would turn those same

But the boastful Scots were beaten, and one of the chroniclers
who record their defeat, reminds them of Seneca's
saying, that never did proud joy stand on a sure
footing. "Now," he adds, by way of moral, "you

ropes of the Englishmen's tails to bind them with,
are yourselves bound in real fetters."<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>

In Wright's collection of medieval political songs,
there are some doggerel verses, which are ascribed
to this same half of the fourteenth century, and
which probably refer to the driving out of the English
from some of the strongholds which they had
occupied. In his crabbed Latin, the writer, doubtless
some monkish patriot, bids Scotland rejoice at
the happy deliverance:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The 'tails' appeared, a while they held their sway,</span>
<span class="i0">But now, at last, they've all been lopped away;</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">Those lines, such as they are, may serve as a
connecting link between the historical instances of
the use of the derogatory appellation and those
which refer to no special incident, but are merely
adaptations of the old scoff for the purpose of
literary invective. The latter are not numerous;
but one of them is interesting from the fact that it
introduces the familiar "tails" under a new name.
It occurs in The <cite>Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy</cite>,
that remarkable production which, though probably
nothing more than a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d'esprit</i>, a kind of friendly
sparring-match between two adversaries "who give
each other plaguy knocks with all the love and
fondness of a brother", is assuredly one of the
most astonishing instances of verbal scurrility to be
found in literature. In this wordy tournament the
two poets allude in uncomplimentary language to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
each other's family history, and Kennedy reproaches
Dunbar, who was a native of Lothian, with being
descended from a traitor, from Corspatrick, who,</p>

<p class="indent">John Skelton, a satirist of the late fifteenth and
the early sixteenth century, has preserved three
Latin hexameters in which a Scottish scholar, George
Dundas, at one time a professor at the University
of Aberdeen, scoffs at the English in the familiar
way, by alluding to their tails. The Englishman
himself, after the battle of Flodden, had written
against the Scots, with the scurrility which characterized
him and which made him obnoxious even to
his own countrymen; and it seems probable that
Dundas's lines occurred in a poem written as a retort.
The only connection between them, however,
consists in the repetition of the same idea in a
slightly different form; and it is hardly possible to
assume that they stood together, and are to be taken
as an epigram. It may also be noted that the first
of them is almost identical with one that is known
to have been current at a much earlier date:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

In whatever connection the lines may have appeared,
they provoked "the noble poet Skelton",
as he styles himself, to a reply which has for its
heading the statement that, "The most vile Scot,
Dundas, alleges that Englishmen have tails".
Apostrophizing him as a "shameless, noxious, foul-mouthed,
lying Scot", he asks him how he dares
utter such a slander. Then, dropping into macaronic
verses, he adorns them with such flowers of
vituperation as these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="indent">Though recalled, some half a century later, by
the insulting piece of by-play which it suggested
to Mary Stuart's French courtiers, and at which, as
we have already recorded, Hatton and his countrymen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
waxed so wroth, the "tailard" taunt is not
again heard in the story of the old feud between
England and Scotland. From the sixteenth century
to its final disappearance from use and even from
memory, it seems to have remained as exclusively
French as it doubtless was in its origin.</p>

<h3>PART II</h3>

<p class="indent">The use which some of the Latin chroniclers and
verse-makers make of the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caudatus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cauda</i>
suggests that the former of these may have been
intended to bear the sense of "cowed" or "coward",
and the latter to symbolize the evil qualities, more
particularly, perhaps, the treachery ascribed to the
English. Thus, in Matthew of Paris, one, at least,
of Count Robert's insulting outbursts, though hardly
both, remains perfectly intelligible even if a figurative
rather than a literal meaning be given to the
epithet.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
And, again, when John Oxenedes, in his
account of the battle of Lewes, fought, in 1264,
between Henry III and the Barons, under Simon
of Montfort, places it in immediate juxtaposition to
"full of guile", "false", "unstable", and "dispirited",
it seems more natural to interpret it as a
reference to a moral defect than to take it as a taunt
at a physical deformity.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
As regards the substantive, a symbolical sense, not, indeed, excluding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
primary meaning, but rather taken in combination
with it, is obviously consistent with the anonymous
poetaster's advice to "cut off that poisonous tail".<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
And the <cite>Annales Gandenses</cite>, the most noteworthy
chronicle of the closing years of the thirteenth and
the beginning of the fourteenth century, whilst
doubtless alluding to the popular belief in a real
caudal appendage worn by Englishmen, seem to
employ the word metaphorically in the passage
which records the incendiarism and the looting by
which the troops of Edward I disgraced themselves
in Ghent, where they had been cordially received
and hospitably entertained by the inhabitants in
1298. "The English, like the most ungrateful
men that they were," says the Minorite author,
"dragging after them their habitual tail, and eager
to plunder the town of Ghent and to slay those that
resisted them, set fire to it in four places, at the
four corners, so to speak, in order that the people
of Ghent, whilst endeavouring to extinguish the
conflagration, should be less careful about the
custody of their property."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
In the <cite>Eulogium Historiarum</cite>, too, there is a passage where the word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cauda</i> occurs in such a connection as to make it
quite clear that the literal acceptation would be out
of place, the more so, indeed, from the circumstance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
that the "tail" is bestowed, not on an
Englishman, but on a Scot, and on a Scot no less
genuine than Robert the Bruce. Referring to the
capture and punishment of the Scottish King's adherents,
the chronicler adds that Bruce himself
found safety in flight and concealment, but that
this did not in the least trouble Edward, who, now
that his enemy's tail was completely cut off, was
quite willing that he should wander about, wherever
he found it easiest to save his life.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
And if, in this instance, the amputation of the tail is a figure of
speech intended to convey the notion of reducing to
powerlessness, it might be argued, with some show
of reason, that, even when applied to Englishmen,
as in the lines which exultingly proclaim how the
French King made them harmless by submitting
them to similar treatment, the expression does not
necessarily imply the actual possession of a real tail.
This would add yet another passage to those which,
if they stood by themselves, would justify some
hesitation in accepting them as proofs of a serious
conviction as to the alleged anatomical peculiarity
of Englishmen. But when the fullest allowance
has been made for all of them, they do not appreciably
affect the evidence of the many witnesses who
not only testify to the general acceptance of the
phenomenon as an actual fact, but are also ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
with a reason for its cause and an explanation of its
origin. The first of these in age, and by no means
the least in point of standing and respectability, is
the biographer Goscelin. He is said to have been
born at or near Terouanne, and was originally a
monk in the monastery of St. Bertin, but was
brought over to England, possibly as early as 1053,
by Hermann, Bishop of Salisbury. Being a monk
at Canterbury, he became interested in the founder
of the see, and not only drew up an account of the
translation of Augustine, a ceremony at which he
was present, but also wrote a life of the Saint. He
professes to have based this work on older records;
and it may be assumed that it embodied local tradition
as it existed prior to the Norman Conquest.
It consists of two versions of the story of the life
of the Apostle of England. One of them, known
as the <cite>Historia Minor Sancti Augustini</cite>, is brief and
compendious. The other, or <cite>Historia Major</cite> as it is
called, which enjoys the distinction of having been
selected by the Bollandists for inclusion in their
Acta Sanctorum, whilst identical with it in substance,
has that greater fulness of details which its
title suggests.</p>

<p class="indent">Both texts relate an incident which is said to
have taken place in the province of Dorset, in a
little village which, for its heathenish impiety, is
likened to the nether regions themselves. There,
the devil-inspired inhabitants not only refused to
give the messenger of the Gospel a hearing, but
also raised a very storm of mocking and contumely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
against the Saint and his companions. In their
shameless audacity, they fastened the tails of sea-fish
to the garments of the holy men. Indignant
at this sacrilegious outrage, the Spirit of the Lord,
through the mouth of Augustine, condemned those
who had committed it to perpetuate in themselves
and in all their posterity the ignominy to which they
had submitted the saints of God.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Shorn of its miraculous and spiteful sequel, and
presented in a form to which critical history is not
compelled to raise objection, the same episode reappears
about the middle of the twelfth century,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
that is, approximatively, a hundred years later, in
the <cite>Gesta Pontificum</cite> of William of Malmesbury.
The chronicler narrates how, at Cerne, in Dorsetshire,
the infuriated inhabitants, at the instigation of
the Evil One, attacked Augustine and his brethren,
and expelled them from their midst, after having
heaped insults upon them, and how they carried the
indignity of their conduct so far as to fasten the
tails of ray-fish, or skate, to the clothes of the
holy missionaries. The attitude which William of
Malmesbury credits Augustine with assuming in
the circumstances seems less in keeping with what
we elsewhere read of the Saint's temper than does
the vengeful sentence which Goscelin makes him
pronounce against the offenders. William says of
him that, for Christ's sake, he bore their affronts
patiently, modestly, and even joyfully, and shaking
against them the dust of his feet, retired a distance
of some three miles, as a precaution against further
irritating the insane anger of the poor people.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">When next the story of the insult offered to
Augustine reappears, the Divine vengeance, which
Goscelin hardly does more than suggest, is unhesitatingly
asserted, and is recorded with a fullness
of details such as medieval credulity would readily
accept as evidence of a genuine miracle. The writer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
to whom we owe the legend in this complete form
is Robert Wace, of Jersey, the Anglo-Norman poet
and author of the <cite>Brut</cite>, a rhymed chronicle written
but a few years, probably not more than a decade,
after William of Malmesbury's <cite>Gesta Pontificum</cite>.
Differing from his predecessors who referred to a
small village as the scene of the incident, Wace lays
it in Dorchester itself, although the conduct which
he attributes to its inhabitants seems in keeping with
rural coarseness rather than with the more refined
civilization of a county town:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="indent">Some fifty years after Robert Wace wrote his
<cite>Brut</cite>, Layamon translated, or rather, paraphrased and
expanded the poem. In this Old English version
of it, St. Augustine's adventure is enriched by the
addition of further details. Layamon's most interesting
contribution to the history of the development
of the legend consists of the information that
an exaggerated notion as to the extent of the Saint's
vengeance had, by this time, got abroad, and that
foreigners now credited all Englishmen indiscriminately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
with the tails which the transgressors themselves
and their posterity had alone been condemned
to bear. That those tails were called "muggles",
and that the men whom they disgraced were nicknamed
"mugglings", are further circumstances for
the knowledge of which we are indebted to Layamon.
And the fact that, whilst one manuscript of his poem
follows Wace with regard to the locality of the
incident, another transfers it from Dorchester to
Rochester, suggests a desire on the part of the
scribe to exonerate the West Country, with which
he may possibly have been connected.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
In Sir F. Madden's prose rendering of the old English <cite>Brut</cite>,
the whole episode is thus given:</p>

<p class="indent">"And so St. Austin drew southward, so that he
came to Dorchester; there he found the worst men
that dwelt in the land. He told them God's lore,
and they had him in derision; he taught them
Christendom, and they grinned at him. Where
the Saint stood, and his clerks with him, and spake
of Christ, as was ever their custom, there they approached
to their injury, and took tails of rays and
hanged them on his cope, on each side. And they
ran beside, and threw at him with the bones, and
afterwards attacked him with grievous stones. And
so they did him shame and drove him out of the
place. To St. Austin they were odious, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
became exceeding wroth; and he proceeded five
miles from Dorchester, and came to a mount that
was mickle and fair; there he lay on his knees in
prayer and called ever toward God, that he should
avenge him of the cursed folk, who had dishonoured
him with their evil deeds. Our Lord heard him, in
heaven, and sent his vengeance on the wretched folk
that hanged the rays' tails on the clerks. The tails
came on them&mdash;therefore they be tailed! Disgraced
was all the race, for muggles they had; and in each
company men call them mugglings, and every freeman
speaketh foul of them, and English freemen in
foreign lands have a red face for the same deed,
and many a good man's son, in strange lands, who
never came there nigh, is called base."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The same occurrence is related in the English
prose version of the <cite>Brut</cite>, with the addition of aggravating
circumstances of violence and contumely.
But what imparts special interest to the passage is
the mention of the ingenious means adopted for
the purpose of evading the hereditary curse:</p>

<p class="indent">"And in the menewhile that the peple turnede

<p class="indent">The <cite>Story of Inglande</cite>, written by Robert Manning
of Brunne, in 1338, contains a section which has the
marginal summary, "Qua de causa Anglici vocantur
Caudati". In his explanation of the reason why
Englishmen are called "tailards", Manning closely
follows Wace, some of whose lines, indeed, he
translates with literal accuracy. He closes his narrative
of the incident, however, in the same manner
as does Layamon, with a protest against the unfairness
of attributing to all Englishmen indiscriminately
the degrading stigma inflicted on a few only of his
countrymen:</p>

<p class="indent">The Biblioth&eacute;que Nationale possesses a manuscript,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
which is ascribed by experts to the fourteenth
century, and in which the legend of St. Augustine
and the tails&mdash;no longer those of ray-fish, however&mdash;supplies
materials for a quaint satire against the
inhabitants of Rochester. It begins with a mock-serious
discussion as to the species of animals to
which they belong. That they are not men is quite
clear, for they have tails, and Aristotle has conclusively
established that men have no tails. And yet
those strange animals have something human about
them, too&mdash;they reason and have laws. For all that,
however, there remains the stern fact that they bear
tails, and this quite precludes the possibility of classing
them as perfect human beings. In the course
of the satire reference is naturally made to the outrage
of which St. Augustine was the victim. After
giving an account of the saint's mission to England,
the anonymous author continues: "As he went
about from city to city, preaching, it happened that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
he preached in the city which is called Rochester.
But, whilst he was preaching, the inhabitants of the
city flocked together about him, and, deeming his
words to be lies, subjected him to many insults.
After reviling him with opprobrious words, they
fastened tails of swine and of cows to the skirt of
his garments, spat into his face, and drove him out
of the city."<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
The saint prayed that they who had
insulted him might be punished, to the end that the
divinity of his mission should be brought home to
them. At the conclusion of his prayer, he wept
bitterly, but was comforted by receiving the assurance
that his petition would be granted. And so,
God, wishing to avenge the insult done to Him and
to his servant, ordained that all who, from that time,
might be born in the city of Rochester, should have
tails, after the fashion of swine. And nothing could
be done to prevent their having tails. From that
day to this, the natives of Rochester have been
tailed, and they shall remain tailed for ever. It is
consequently evident that they are not human beings.
Amongst the inconveniences resulting from this
peculiarity of theirs, is that of not being able to
sit down when they are angry; for, at such a time,
their tails stand erect, as is the case with other
animals.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>

During the fourteenth century, too, the myth, in
its restricted and local form, makes its appearance
in Continental literature, other than that of France.
It is referred to by Fazio degli Uberti, an Italian
poet who lived between 1326 and 1360, and whom
D. G. Rossetti deals with and translates in his
work <cite>Italian Poets chiefly before Dante</cite>. In a description
of England which Fazio gives in the <cite>Ditta
Mondo</cite>, he says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now this I saw not; but so strange a thing</span>
<span class="i0">It was to hear, and by all men confirmed,</span>
<span class="i0">That it is fit to note it as I heard,</span>
<span class="i0">To wit, there is a certain islet here</span>
<span class="i0">Among the rest where folk are born with tails,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Short as are found in stags and suchlike beasts".<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Fazio is probably Boccaccio's authority for the
statement, unaccompanied with any further details,
however, that "certain Englishmen were born with
tails".<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
The chronicle which is commonly known as Alexander
of Essebye's, and which exists in manuscript
only, has been quoted as briefly stating that "when
fish tails were despitefully thrown at him by certaine
men of Dorsetshire", St. Augustine "was so furiously
vexed therewith that he called upon God for revenge
and He forthwith heard him and strake them with
tails for their punishment". Greater interest attaches
to the story as told in the English version of the
<cite>Golden Legende</cite>. Though not less credulous than
were his predecessors as to the punishment inflicted
on the impious people who insulted the saint, the
writer who interpolated the narrative&mdash;for it does
not appear in the Latin original&mdash;prepares the way
of the sceptic by limiting the duration of the penalty,
and by testifying with an earnestness suggestive of
personal knowledge to the immunity of some, at
least, of those who were believed to be stricken for
the transgression of their forefathers:</p>

<p class="indent">"After this Saynt Austyn entryd into Dorsetshyre
and came into a towne whereas were wycked peple
and refused his doctryne and prechyng utterly, and
droof him out of the towne, castyng on him the
tayles of thornback or like fisshes, wherefor he besought
Almyghty God to shewe his jugement on
them, and God sente to them a shameful token, for
the children that were borne after in that place had
tayles, as it is said, tyl they had repented them. It
is sayd comynly that thys fyl at Strode in Kente;
but, blessyd be God, at this day is no such deformyte."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
By the middle of the fifteenth century, the legend
of the tails had undergone important modifications.
The original account of the outrage and of its
punishment was still current; but, by the side of it,
there existed several versions which affected not
merely the circumstances of time and place, but also
the individuality of the persons concerned in the
incident. We are indebted to Walter Bower, who
expanded and continued Fordun's <cite>Scotichronicon</cite>, for
an interesting passage in which the old story and
its subsequent variants are presented together. The
Scottish chronicler, taking Wace's narrative as his
starting-point, relates that when St. Augustine was
preaching the word of life to the heathen, amongst
the West Saxons, in the county of Dorset, he came
to a certain town where no one would receive him
or listen to his preaching. They opposed him rebelliously
in everything, contradicted all he said, did
their utmost to distort his actions, on which they
put sinister interpretations, and, impious to relate,
carried their audacity so far as to sew and hang fish
tails to his garments. But what they intended as
an insult to the holy father brought eternal disgrace
on themselves and on their posterity, and opprobrium
on their unoffending country. He smote
them in the hinder parts and cast lasting shame
upon them by causing similar tails to grow both on
their own persons and on those of their offspring.
And here the Abbot of Inchcolm becomes particularly
interesting by reason of the wholly new information
which he imparts. He states that there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
a special name for the punitive tail. "Such a tail,"
he says, "is called Mughel by the natives, in the
language of their country; and because of this, the
place where St. Augustine was thus insulted received
the name of Muglington, that is, the town
of the Muglings, and still bears it at the present
day." It is to be regretted that the topographical
indication is not more definite. The modern map
of England knows no Muglington. Wherever it
may have been, it would seem that it did not stand
alone as a monument of St. Augustine's power and
spite. According to Bower, it is also related that
a similar indignity was done to him in the province
of Mercia, by the inhabitants of a town called
Thamewyth. But they were not allowed to go
unpunished either; for, "as is known to all", they
were put to shame by the infliction of the like opprobrious
punishment.</p>

<p class="indent">It is from its concluding part, however, that
Bower's account derives its chief importance and its
value as a contribution to the history of the development
of the myth. "Something similar," he says,
"happened at a later period, during the exile of
St. Thomas, Primate of England, when the people
of Rochester, intending it as an insult to him,
docked his horse's tail. But their iniquitous action
was foiled of its purpose and recoiled on themselves;
for it was found that thenceforth all the children
born in that place were tailed."<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
From this we first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
learn that a new character had by this time assumed
a part in the story. Hitherto, the responsibility for
having endowed Englishmen with tails had rested
with St. Augustine alone. And his monopoly of
the doubtful honour had endured through four
centuries. Henceforth, though he was not to disappear
altogether, he was to have a rival.</p>

<p class="indent">In the case of Becket, as in that of his predecessor,
there was a basis of historical fact on which to build
up a legend.</p>

<p class="indent">The chroniclers Ralph de Diceto, Roger de Hoveden,
and both William and Gervase of Canterbury,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
who record the murder of Becket, and whose proximity,
in point of time, to the events that took place
on those memorable December days of the year
1170, gives them indisputable authority, all agree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
in narrating, with such slight variations in matters
of detail as serve to show that they did not merely
repeat each other, an incident which happened to
the Archbishop shortly before his death. They
state that Robert Broc, a groom of the royal bedchamber,
who, together with Nigel de Sacheville,
incumbent of Harrow, was solemnly excommunicated
by the Primate, on Christmas day, had cut
off the tail of Becket's horse, as an insult to its
owner. According to the two brother-monks, the
Archbishop made direct reference to this indignity
in his interview with the four conspirators, Reginald
Fitzurse, Hugh de Moreville, William de Tracy,
and Richard le Breton. "The tail of a mare in my
service," he said, "has been shamefully cut off, as
if I could be disgraced by the docking of a brute
beast."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
It was not, however, for this cowardly and
contemptible act of spite that Broc was excommunicated,
but because, being a layman, he had appropriated
ecclesiastical revenues. And, though William
of Canterbury records that the very dogs refused
to be fed by the hand of the man whom the Prelate
had banned, neither he nor any of the other
chroniclers refers to the infliction of tails on him
or his posterity. It was only at a later date, and
when Broc had been lost sight of, as the perpetrator

thought of.</p>

Although there is the evidence of Bower to show
that, in his day, Becket's name had already begun
to be connected with the legend of the tails, Augustine
still continues to hold his own through the
whole of the first half of the sixteenth century. It
is he who figures as the hero, or the victim, in the
account given by John Major, an account which is
noteworthy by reason of the very cautious spirit in
which it is written. It may be said to mark the
beginning of a transition from unquestioning credulity
to uncompromising scepticism. It also seems
to imply that, so far as the author's reading of the
chroniclers extended, he found the English, if not
yet ready to deny the supernatural punishment of
the insult offered to the saint, at least convinced
that it had not been perpetuated through the ages.
The chapter in which Major recapitulates the old
story, is mainly devoted to the outward form and
appearance of the English, and contains a great deal
about "skiey influence". Thus, it comes of "skiey
influence" that close by the Arctic pole people are
of foul aspect. And, if in some parts of Africa
men are born with the head of a dog, "this, too, is
a matter of skiey influence and carries with it no
other influence". After this preamble the author
proceeds to relate the conversion of Kent&mdash;how
Augustine laboured so strenuously that, in a short
space of time, he brought to the faith the king himself
and almost the whole people; how, passing on
to Rochester, he began there, too, to preach the
word of God; and how the common people derided
him, and threw fish tails at the holy man. "Wherefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Augustine made his prayer to God that, for
punishment of this sin, their infants should be born
with tails, to the end they might be warned not to
contemn the teachers of divine things. And, for
this reason, as the English chroniclers relate, the
infants were born with tails; but for a time only,
and to the end that an unbelieving race might give
credence to their teacher, was this punishment inflicted."
The Scots and the Gauls, it is true, "assert
the opposite". But, Major "cannot agree with
them". And, further, the phenomenon having been
only temporary, he gives it as his opinion that it
had "very little to do with the skiey influence".<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>

<p class="indent">Nicole Gilles whose "very elegant and copious
annals of Gaul" were published in 1531, being a
French chronicler, is one of those who believe that
the divine anger has not ceased to manifest itself,
and that the descendants of the men of Dorchester,
who mocked and derided St. Augustine, still have
"tails behind, like brute beasts, and are therefore
called tailed Englishmen". It is worthy of notice
that, owing, doubtless, to the misreading of some
Latin text and to the intelligible confusion of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">raia</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">raria</i>, both of which are used to translate "rayfish",
with the more familiar <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rana</i>, Gilles makes the

Bellenden, who belonged to the next generation,
took the liberty of introducing the Augustinian
myth into his Scottish prose rendering of Hector
Boece, although there was nothing in the Latin
original to justify him in doing so.</p>

<p class="indent">"Quhen this haly man, Sanct Austine, wes
precheand to the Saxonis in Miglintoun," he says,
"thay wer nocht onlie rebelland to his precheing,
but in his contemptioun thay sewit fische talis on

with skait rumpillis. Nochtheless, this derisioun

</p>

<p class="indent">Bower and the prose <cite>Brut</cite> are obviously the
authorities for Bellenden's statements, and it is not
without interest to note that whilst drawing from
the latter his knowledge of the subterfuge by means
of which cunning mothers might secure for their
children immunity from the consequences of the
saint's vindictiveness, it is from his Scottish predecessor
that he takes the name of the town which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
witnessed the affront, and in which the punishment
was perpetuated. And the question arises whether
the chronicler's apparently deliberate choice of
Miglinton is to be taken as evidence that a place
bearing that name, or rather nickname, really existed.</p>

<p class="indent">Though Dunbar's brief reference to the insult
offered to St. Augustine proves nothing beyond his
acquaintance with the legend, it may be quoted, for
the sake of completeness. It occurs in the <cite>Flyting
with Kennedy</cite>, at whom his adversary flings the jeer,</p>

<p class="indent">The Frenchman G&eacute;n&eacute;brard is the last of those
who, as long as the story continued to be accepted
or, at least, not openly scouted, connected it with
Augustine. He confines himself to recording the
outrage, and to stating, with due caution, that,
because of it, the people of Dorchester "are said to
have had tails like beasts". His own belief in the
prodigy does not appear to have been very firm.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Of those who, after Bower, present St. Thomas
as the central figure in the incident, the first in
date is a foreigner, Wilwolt of Schaumburg. This
German gentleman errant visited England about the
end of the fifteenth century, and an account of his
travels was published in 1507. He appears to have
been greatly impressed by the story of St. Thomas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
of Candlwerg, as he calls him, and relates how
"he left behind him a wonderful token which will
perhaps endure to the day of judgment". On one
occasion, he says, riding like a pious and upright
man, on his little ass, the holy man came to a certain
village where he stopped to take some food. Here
the country folk made fun of his lowly mount, and
cut off the poor ass's tail. Thereupon, the dear
saint complained to Almighty God, and prayed to
such purpose that, even to this very day, all the
boys that are born in that village bring with them
into the world little tails rooted to their hinder parts.
From this circumstance has arisen the byword
which so greatly annoys the English: "Englishman,
show your tail!" And continues Wilwolt, "I
should like to see the foolhardy man who dared to
call out, 'English tailard' in that same village. He
would have to take himself off very quickly if he
did not wish to be beaten to death." The German
traveller also learnt how, at the right moment,
women could avert from the expected child the
grievous consequences of its forefathers' fault.
They only had to cross the water and go into the
next village.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Another and better known foreigner, no less a
personage, indeed, than Polydore Vergil, continues,
at the same time that he considerably restricts, the
legend of the tails. As narrated by him in the
<cite>Anglica Historia</cite>, published in 1534, Becket's misadventure
appears to have been one of the minor
incidents in the quarrel between him and the king.
It had become known that Henry had been moved
to exclaim, "Wretched me! Can I not have peace
in my own kingdom because of one priest? Is
there none of all my subjects who will rid me of
that annoyance?" And there were not wanting evil
men who understood this to mean that, in his heart,
he desired the death of the Archbishop who, in
consequence, began to be generally neglected, despised,
and hated. Such was the position of affairs
when Thomas one day came to Stroud, on the
Medway, near Rochester. There, the inhabitants,
anxious to inflict some insult on the good father,
now that he was in disgrace, did not hesitate to cut
off the tail of the horse on which he was riding.
By this act, however, it was on themselves that they
brought lasting shame. For, by the judgment of
God, it happened that the descendants of the men
who had perpetrated this outrage were born with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
tails, like brute beasts. But if the learned Italian
was superstitious enough to believe in the miraculous
punishment of an offence which, at its worst, involved
far less moral guilt than was incurred by the
murderers of Becket, against whom no divine retribution
was recorded, he was too intelligent not
to see the absurdity of making it perpetual, and of
inflicting it on the community at large, as earlier
chroniclers had done. He admitted that the mark
of infamy had not survived the family of the immediate
offenders.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>

<p class="indent">The next and last writer of what may be called
the period of credulity, though that credulity had
begun to wane long before it reached its vanishing
phase in him, was Guillaume Paradin, of Cuiseaux.
He confesses to a suspicion that what tradition has
handed down concerning the tails of Englishmen is
mere nonsense, and apologizes for reproducing it,
on the score that English chroniclers themselves
report it quite seriously. The Becket legend which
he thus introduces affords him an opportunity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
adapting to the English the words of the Royal
prophet, "He smote them in the hinder parts and
put them to a perpetual shame"; and of perpetrating,
at their expense, some doggerel lines of which
he has the good sense not to acknowledge the
authorship:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of old, some Britons docked the tail</span>

<p class="indent">By the middle of the sixteenth century, saints had
ceased to command the same popular reverence as
before, and their alleged miracles were put by many
on the same level as the myths of antiquity. There
is, consequently, from that date onwards an absolute
change in the tone and temper of those who
allude to the legend of the tails. Most of them,
indeed, do so for the sole purpose of denying the
miracle and of sneering at those who superstitiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
gave it credence. The first and not least indignant
of the denunciators is John Bale, Bishop of Ossory.
After indicating the discrepancy between John Capgrave
and Alexander of Esseby&mdash;that is, Ashby&mdash;who
record that, "for castynge of fyshe tayles at
thys Augustine, Dorsett shyre men had tayles ever
after", and Polydore Vergil, who "applyeth it unto
Kentysh men at Stroude, by Rochester, for cuttynge
of Thomas Beckett's horse's tayle", the author of the
<cite>Actes of Englysh Votaryes</cite> says: "Thus hath England,
in all other landes, a perpetual dyffamy of tayles by
their wrytten legendes of lyes, yet can they not wele
tell where to bestowe them trulye".<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
In another passage he inveighs still more bitterly against "the
Spiritual Sodomytes" who "in the legends of their
sanctyfied sorcerers", have "dyffamed the Englyshe
posteryte with tayles", and to whom it is due "that
an Englishman now cannot travayle in any other
lande by way of merchandyce or anye other honest
occupyenge, but yt ys most contumelyousslye
throwne in his teeth, that all Englishmen have
tayles". And concludes the Bishop in his wrath,
"that uncomlye note and report have the nacyon
gotten without recover, by these laysye and idell
lubbers, the munkes and the prestes, whiche coulde
fynde no matters to advance their canonysed Cayns
by, or their Sayntes (as they call them) but manyfest
lyes and knaveryes".<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">Bale's <cite>Actes</cite> appeared in 1546. Seventy years later,
William Lambarde published a <cite>Perambulation of Kent</cite>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Coming to Stroud, in this topographical and historical
account of his native county, he eagerly avails
himself of the opportunity offered him to record his
protest against the attribution of tails, not only to
the natives of that locality, but to the Kentish men
generally, and that&mdash;unkindest cut of all&mdash;by their
own fellow countrymen. He is evidently acquainted
with several versions of the story; but whilst denouncing
the authors of all of them, he is particularly
incensed against Polydore, whom he quite unjustly
accuses of "lashing out further" than his authorities,
and of endeavouring "to outly the lowdest Legendaries".
It is bad enough that "the whole English
nation should be earnestly flowted" with the "dishonourable
note" of having tails; but what Lambarde
obviously finds it more difficult to bear, and makes
Polydore responsible for, is that "Kentish men be
heere at home merily mocked". In his most entertaining
contribution to the history of the legend, the
Kentish apologist says:</p>

<p class="indent">"A name, or family of men, sometime inhabiting
Stroude (saith Polydore) had tailes clapped to their
breeches by Thomas Becket, for revenge and punishment
of a dispite done to him, in cutting of the
taile of his horse. The author of the new Legend
saith, that after St. Thomas had excommunicated
two Brothers (called Brockes) for the same cause,
that the Dogges under the table would not once
take bread at their hands. Such (belike) was the
vertue of his curse, that it gave to brute beasts,
a discretion and knowledge of the persons, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
were in danger of it. Boetius (the Scotishe chronicler)
writeth, that the lyke plague lighted upon the
men of Midleton in Dorsetshire: who because
they threwe Fish tailes in great contempt at Saint
Augustine, were bothe themselves and their posteritie,
stricken with tailis, to their perpetual infamy
and punishment. All whiche their reportes (no
doubt) be as true, as Ovides Historie of Diana,
that in great angre bestowed on Act&aelig;on a Deares
head with mighty anthlers.</p>

<p class="indent">"Much are the Western men bound (as you see)
to Polydore, who taking the miracle from Augustine,
applieth it to S. Thomas, and removing the infamous
revenge from Dorsetshire, laieth it upon
our men of Kent. But little is Kent, or the whole
English nation beholding, either to him, or his
fellowes, who (amongst them) have brought upon
us this ignominie and note with other nations
abrode, that many of them believe as verity, that
we have long tailes and be monsters by nature, as
other men have their due partes and members in
usual number. Polydore (the wisest of the companye)
fearing that issue might be taken upon the
matter, ascribeth it to one speciall stocke and family,
which he nameth not, and yet (to leave it the more
uncertain) he saith, that, that family is worne out
long since, and sheweth not when; he goeth about
in great earnest (as in sundrie other things) to
make the world beleave he cannot tell what: he
had forgotten the Lawe whereunto an Hystorian is
bound, 'Ne quid falsi audeat, ne quid veri non
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
audeat'. That he should be bold as to tell the
trueth, and yet not so bolde as to tell a lye."</p>

<p class="indent">To his credit, however, Lambarde does Polydore
the justice of admitting that his history, "without
all doubt", is "a worthy work", in places not
blemished with such follies. But, seeing that he
does insert them often and without discretion, he
must be read with great suspicion and wariness.
"For, as he was by office Collector of the Peter
pence to the Popes gaine and lucre, so sheweth he
himselfe throughout by profession, a coveteous
gatherer of lying fables, fained to advance the
Popish religion, kingdome and myter."<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">In the seventeenth century, the story of the tails,
which, by that time, however, had ceased to be
attributed to Englishmen at large and were humorously
regarded as distinctive of Kentish men alone,
was incidentally referred to by several poets. It
supplied Sir John Mennis, the author of <cite>Musarum
Delice&aelig;</cite>, with a coarse joke. Andrew Marvel, in
his <cite>Loyal Scot</cite>, cites it in illustration of the danger
incurred by provoking the anger of a prelate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="indent">In Drayton's <cite>Polyolbion</cite>, the "Blazons of the

<p class="indent">Butler, in his <cite>Hudibras</cite>, has a couplet which
declares that:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">tails by nature sure were meant</span>
<span class="i0">As well as beards, for ornament.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">According to an annotator, "Mr. Butler here
alludes to Dr. Bulwer's <cite>Artificial Changeling</cite>", where,
besides the story of the Kentish men, near Rochester,
who had tails clapped to their breeches by Thomas
&agrave; Becket, he gives an account, on the authority of
"an honest young man of Captain Morris's company
in Lieutenant-General Ireton's company", of
how "at Cashell in the County of Tipperary, in the
province of Munster, in Carrick Patrick church,
seated on a hill or rock, stormed by the Lord
Inchequine, and where were neare 700 put to the
sword and none saved but the Mayor's wife and
his son, there were found among the slain of the
Irish, when they were stript, divers with tailes
near a quarter of a yard long. The relator being
very diffident of the truth of this story, after
enquiry was ensured of the certainty thereof by
forty souldiers, that testified upon their oaths that
they were eyewitnesses, being present at the
action." With such testimony in support of his
assertion that "the rump bone among brutish and
strong-docht nations doth often spread out with
such an excrescence or beastly emanation", Dr. Bulwer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
is not disinclined to believe in the possession
of tails by the inhabitants of Stroud.</p>

<p class="indent">In the <cite>Church History of Britain</cite> by Dr. Bulwer's
contemporary, Thomas Fuller, modern scepticism
again asserts itself. Quoting from Hierome Porter,
in the <cite>Flowers of the Lives of the Saints</cite>, to the effect
that when the villagers in Dorsetshire beat Augustine
and his fellows, and in mockery fastened fish tails
at their backs, in punishment hereof, "all that
generation had that given them by nature, which
so contemptibly they fastened on the backs of these
holy men", Fuller adduces this to show that "most
of the miracles assigned unto Augustine, intended
with their strangeness to raise and heighten, with
their levity and absurdity do depress and offend,
true devotion". In equal contempt of those who
relate such a story as that of the Dorsetshire folk
and of those who accept it, the author exclaims,
"Fie for shame! He needs an hard plate on his
face that reports it, and a soft place in his head that
believes it".<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">In his <cite>Worthies of England</cite>, the same writer
discusses at some length the origin of the nickname
applied to the Kentish men. "Let me premise,"
he says, "that those are much mistaken, who first
found the proverb on a miracle of Austin the
Monk, for the scene of this lying wonder was
not laied in any part of Kent, but pretended many
miles off, nigh Cerne in Dorsetshire." His own
opinion is that the saying is "first of outlandish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
extraction and cast by Forrainers as a note of
disgrace on all the English, though it chanceth to
stick only on the Kentish men at this day". In
support of this view, Fuller relates the incident
of the quarrel "betwixt Robert, Brother of Saint
Louis, King of France and our William Longspee,
Earle of Salisbury". Continuing his disquisition
he says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Some will have the English so-called from wearing
a pouch or poake (a bag to carry their baggage
in) behind their backs, whilst probably the proud
Monsieurs had their lacquies for that purpose; in
proof whereof, they produce ancient Pictures of the
English Drapery and Armory, wherein such conveyances
doe appear. If so, it was neither sin nor
shame for the common sorte of people to carry their
own necessaries; and it matters not much whether
the pocket be made on either side, or wholly behind.
If any demand how this nickname (cut off from the
rest of England) continues still entailed on Kent.
The best conjecture is, because that County lieth
nearest to France, and the French are beheld as the
first founders of this aspersion. But if any will
have the Kentish men so-called from drawing and
dragging boughs of trees behind them, which afterwards
they advanced above their heads, and so
partly cozened, partly threatened, King William the
Conqueror to continue their ancient customes; I
say, if any will impute it to this original, I will not
oppose."<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
The incident upon which Fuller bases the explanation
which he considers most plausible, without,
however, expressing himself dogmatically with regard
to it, is related by the chronicler Willam
Thorne, and also forms the subject of an old ballad
quoted by Thierry. So modern an historian as
Lappenberg thinks that "perhaps the tradition is
not unfounded, that the Kentish army, advancing
under the covering of branches from the trees,
might have appeared to the enemy as a wood, until,
standing in face of them and casting down their
leafy screen, they at once appeared threatening with
sword and spear". Freeman rejects the story altogether.
But even its truth, which Fuller may be
excused for accepting, would hardly support his
theory. The only credit which it deserves is perhaps
the negative one of being a little less fanciful
than that put forward by Fynes Moryson, who states
that "the Kentish men of old were said to have
tayles, because trafficking in the Low Countries,
they never paid full payments of what they did
owe, but still left some part unpaid".<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">The author of the early sixteenth-century <cite>Mad
Pranks and Merry Jests of Robin Goodfellow</cite>, contributes
no less than three other explanations, of
which one bears considerable resemblance to that
favoured by Fuller. After relating how he dropped
into an alehouse, whilst travelling in "that noble
county of Kent", he continues:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
"The ale being good, and I in good company,
I lapt in so much of this nappy liquor, that it begot
in mee a boldnesse to talk and desire of them to
know what was the reason that the people of that
country were called Long-tayles. The hoast said,
all the reason that ever he could heare was, because
the people of that country did use to goe in side-skirted
coates. There is (sayd an old man that sat
by) another reason that I have heard: that is this.
In the time of the Saxons' conquest of England
there were divers of our countrymen slaine by
treachery, which made those that survived more
carefull in dealing with their enemies, as you shall
heare. After many overthrowes that our countrymen
had received by the Saxons, they dispersed
themselves into divers companies into the woods,
and so did much damage by their suddaine assaults
to the Saxons, that Hengist, their king, hearing the
damage that they did (and not knowing how to
subdue them by force) used this policy. Hee sent
to a company of them and gave them his word for
their liberty and safe returne, if they would come
unarmed and speake with him. This they seemed
to grant unto, but for their more security (knowing
how little hee esteemed oaths or promises) they went
every one of them armed with a shorte sword, hanging
just behind under their garments, so that the
Saxons thought not of any weapons they had: but
it proved otherwise, for when Hengist his men (that
were placed to cut them off) fell all upon them,
they found such unlooked a resistance that most

wond'ring how they could do that hurt, having no
weapons (as they saw), reported that they strucke
downe men like lyons with their tayles; and so
they, ever after, were called Kentish Long-tayles.
I told them this was strange, if true, and that their
countries honor bound them more to believe in this,
than it did me. Truly, Sir, said my hoastesse, I
thinke we are called Long-tayles, by reason our tales
are long, that we use to passe the time withall, and
make ourselves merry."</p>

<p class="indent">Du Cange considered the problem more seriously,
without, however, being able to find a satisfactory
solution. He suggests that the epithet "tailed"
may have been applied to Englishmen because of
the excess to which they carried the fashion of wearing
toes of extravagant length to their shoes, but
admits that the explanation does not greatly appeal
to him. With still more diffidence he hints at the
possibility of considering the Latin "caudatus" as
equivalent to either "foppish" or "cowardly". But
whilst none of the cited instances of its use justifies
the former of these interpretations, there are only a
very few of them that can be strained into imparting
even slight plausibility to the latter. Neither does
there appear to be anything to support Professor
Wattenbach's suggestion that Englishmen may have
been called "tailed" because of the way in which
they wore their hair. Finally, a work entitled
<cite>England under the Normans</cite> has a chapter on the
measurement of land, in which the author states
that "there was a mile peculiar to Kent, as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
a customary field admeasurement", and that "these
'long tales' are possibly the 'long tails' of which
the county used to be so proud". The history of
the medieval myth does not lead to the belief that
either Englishmen generally, or, as here stated,
Kentishmen in particular, ever looked upon the
nickname otherwise than as an insult.</p>

<p class="indent">The attempts that have been made to fix upon
some actual fact as originating the attribution of
tails to Englishmen seem as uncalled for as most of
them are fanciful and absurd.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
They are all based on the hypothesis that the epithet "caudatus",
"cou&eacute;", and "tailard" was first applied for some
reason other than the belief in the existence of a
tail, and that only subsequently, if, indeed, ever,
was it taken literally. But our investigation has
proved that there is nothing to warrant this assumption.
It has been shown that, on the contrary,
the actual monstrosity was accepted as a fact from
the outset. Nor does it seem impossible to explain
how this came about. Given the insult offered to
St. Augustine, about which there is no room for
scepticism, it only requires a knowledge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
medieval spirit to account for the sequel. Impressed
by the sanctity of the apostle of England and by
the greatness, or, indeed, the divinity of his mission,
the early biographer looked upon it as inevitable
that the sacrilege of those who dishonoured him
should draw down upon them the wrath of Heaven.
Was not the disrespect of the children who called
the Prophet "bald head" visited upon them? The
conviction that this should be the case easily led to
the assumption that it was. And a very slight
effort of imagination sufficed to devise a punishment
suited to the offence. It was suggested by
the very nature of the impious deed. And what,
to the chronicler, seemed the application of an
obvious principle&mdash;that the transgression should
fall back upon the transgressor&mdash;was accepted by
the credulity of the age. Then there was the
animosity of other nations, of France in particular,
and of Scotland, her ally. If, at home, the manifestation
of divine anger and of saintly power was
thought to be limited to the kith and kin of the
offenders, such nicety of distinction was ignored
abroad. It suited the enemies of England that all
Englishmen should be "tailards", and "tailards"
they were universally and indiscriminately called.</p>

As bearing on the subject of Mary's personal appearance and
the fidelity of her portraits, the following passages from an article
contributed to the <cite>Glasgow Herald</cite>, as a review of Mr. J. J. Foster's
work, <cite>Concerning the True Portraiture of Mary Queen of Scots</cite>, may
here be reproduced: "Mr. Foster points out 'in some cases a slight but
perceptible squint'. We have noticed this in one or two instances only,
and in portraits which, though they may be authentic, are technically
inferior; and we are consequently more inclined to attribute the defect
to the artist than to nature. The majority of the most trustworthy
portraits agree in making the upper eyelids thick, with an uninterrupted
curve, in setting the arched, well-marked eyebrows wide apart, and in
giving an exceptionally broad space between the eyes and the ears. The
oval face, the high cheek-bones, the round, well-proportioned and
capacious forehead, the long but shapely Greek nose, are features with
regard to which there is practical unanimity. Even if Sir George Scharf
had not pointed it out, it would hardly be possible to overlook the
peculiarity of the compressed lips. They are not thin, however, though,
on the other hand, they are very far from possessing that fulness which
physiognomists look upon as an indication of sensuality. Another
feature, so often reproduced as to be almost characteristic and
distinctive, is the strongly-marked V depression in the middle of the
upper lip. The cheek is full in its lower part, but not unduly so. The
chin is well-developed, but is neither cloven nor dimpled.... Prince
Labanoff declared that, with the exception of one portrait&mdash;and that of
dubious authenticity&mdash;none renders even youth or average beauty. Quite
recently Major Martin Hume wrote of Mary that 'a contemplation of her
known authentic portraits, even those taken in the best years of her
youth and happiness, does not carry conviction that her physical beauty
alone can have been the cause of the extraordinary influence she
exercised over the men who came within the sphere of her attraction'.
And now we have Mr. Foster admitting that 'scarcely any of the so-called
portraits of Mary Stuart bear out the reputation of her beauty'; and
that 'all her pictures entirely lack that indefinable charm which
captivated everyone brought in contact with her'. He seems to attribute
this, in some measure, at least, to the imperfections of the artists of
the time. He might perhaps have added, to the unfavourable circumstances
under which they worked. For, as M. Dimier tells us, 'the oil-painting
was never attempted from life. The artist brought away from his model
nothing but the crayon and some written notes concerning the complexion,
colour of hair, and of the eyes; he handled the colours only in his
studio, and finished the work at his leisure'. We know, too, of Mary
Stuart, in particular, that she ordered portraits of herself to be
painted in France, fourteen years after leaving the country."

Calderwood, <cite>History of the Kirk of Scotland</cite>, vol. i,
pp. 101-2. Another and less prejudiced account of this John Scott is
given by Peder Swave, who visited Scotland in 1535, as Ambassador from
Christian II of Denmark to James V: "On the 11th of May I met with a
hermit, named John Scott, a person of noble rank, who had quitted a
beautiful wife, and children, and all his household, and determined to
live by himself in solitude. He ate nothing but bread, and drank
nothing save water or milk. He is believed to have endured a fast of
forty days and nights in Scotland, England, and Italy. He also says
that, when impelled by a higher power, he could not perish by fasting,
as by the kindness of the Holy Virgin he has already been able to
prove; if he should wish to do this by way of wager or bargain, that
he would fail. He declares that he has no sensation of hunger when he
fasts, that he loses neither his strength nor his flesh, feels neither
heat nor cold, goes about with head and feet naked equally in summer
and winter, and that his manner of life does not induce the approaches
of age. Asked by me why he left such a beautiful wife, he replied that
he wished to be a soldier of Heaven, and that whether his wife
determined to serve God or the world was a matter of indifference to
him. By chance there was amongst us a canon regular who said that he
had been asked by the hermit's wife to reconcile them, but had taken
the task upon him to no purpose."&mdash;Hume Brown, <cite>Early Travellers in
Scotland</cite>, p. 56.

"In the <cite>Muses' Welcome to King James</cite>,
printed at Edinburgh in 1618, folio, the royal visitor greeted
his Scottish subjects with a string of punning rhymes on the names
of certain learned professors, which some of them were sagacious
enough to turn into Latin. As a sample of the literary taste which
prevailed at this academic visitation, these quibbling verses on
the name of the college disputants are here subjoined:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As <em>Adam</em> was the first of men, whence all beginning tak</span>
<span class="i0">So <em>Adam-son</em> was president, and first man in this act.</span>
<span class="i0">The theses <em>Fair-lie</em> did defend, which though they lies contain,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet were <em>fair-lies</em> and he the same right fairlie did maintain.</span>
<span class="i0">The field first entred master <em>Sands</em>, and there he made me see</span>
<span class="i0">That not all <em>Sands</em> are barren sands, but that some fertile bee.</span>
<span class="i0">Then master <em>Young</em> most subtilie the theses did impugne,</span>
<span class="i0">And kythed <em>old</em> in Aristotle, although his name bee Young.</span>
<span class="i0">To him succeeded master Reid, who though <em>reid</em> be his name</span>
<span class="i0">Neids neither for his disput blush, nor of his speach think shame.</span>
<span class="i0">Last entred master <em>King</em> the lists, and dispute like a <em>King</em></span>
<span class="i0">How reason reigning as a <em>queene</em> should anger underbring.</span>
<span class="i0">To their deserved praise have I thus played upon their names;</span>

As Goscelin is the first writer in whom there occurs mention of the insult
offered to St. Augustine and of its punishment, and as it consequently seems to
be with him that the "tail" myth originated, both his versions of the incident
are here given:&mdash;"Hinc divertens dux verbi Domini, successit tandem cuidam
profanae villulae in Provincia quae dicitur Dorseta; ubi daemoniaca plebicola
Sanctos Dei omnibus opprobriis ac ludibriis dedecoravere; adeo ut (quod etiam
referri injuria est) productas piscium caudas ingererent. Unde indignatus
Spiritus Domini in hujus auctores sceleris et in omnem progeniem illorum
suum dedecus per os Augustini vatis perpetualiter sententiavit; et pravis propriam
ignominiam, Sanctis vero perennem gloriam refudit" (<cite>Anglia Sacra</cite>,
II, p. 67).&mdash;"Cumque (Augustinus) provinciam quae Dorsete appellatur, attigisset,
et ubique ut Angelus Domini reciperetur, simulque auditorum fide quos
pasceret pasceretur, incidit in quamdam villam, velut in tartaream Plutonis
sedem. Ibi plebs impia, tenebris suis excaecata, et divinam lucem exosa, non
solum audire nequibat vivifica documenta, verum tota ludibriorum et opprobriorum
tempestate in Sanctos Dei debacchata, longe proturbat eos ab omni
possessione sua; nec manu pepercisse creditur effraenis audacia. At Dei
nuntius, juxta Dominicum praeceptum et apostolorum exemplum, excusso
etiam pulvere pedum in eos, dignam suis meritis sententiam (non maledicentis
voto, quia omnium salutem optabat; sed divino judicio et Eliae typo) atrocibus
injecit, quatenus Sanctorum contemptores tam in ipsis quam in omnibus
posteris suis, debita poena redargueret, qui vitae mandata repulissent. Fama
est, illos effulminandos, prominentes marinorum piscium caudas Sanctis appendisse;
et illis quidem gloriam sempiternam peperisse, in se vero ignominiam
perennem retorsisse, ut hoc dedecus degeneranti generi, non innocenti et
generosae imputetur patriae" (Bollandists, <cite>Acta Sanctorum</cite>, vol. for May, p. 375).

The obnoxious tail appears to have been passed on to
Cornwall. In his <cite>Curious Myths of the Middle Ages</cite>, Mr. Baring Gould
states that, as a child, he firmly believed, on the authority of his
nurse, that all Cornishmen were born with tails. It required the
solemn assurance of a native to convince him of the contrary.

"Cum apud occidentales Saxones, in pago Dorsetensi,

caudae nascerentur. Vocatur autem hujusmodi cauda ab indigenis patri&acirc;
lingu&acirc; Mughel; unde et villa, in qua beato Augustino hujusmodi
irrogata est injuria, nomen sortita est Muglington, id est villa
Muglingorum, usque in praesentem diem. Fertur etiam qu&ograve;d, eorum
exemplo, in provincia Merciorum, in villa quae Thamewyth dicitur,
beato viro ab incolis loci simile dedecus factum fuerit; sed non
impune: quia tam ipsi quam eorum posteri, sicut omnibus notum est,
pari poena et opprobrio verecundati sunt. Simile postea accidit
tempore exilii beati Thomae primatis Angliae, quod ad ejus opprobrium,
ut aestimabant, sed mentita est iniquitas sibi, illi de Rocestria
deturpaverunt et absciderunt caudam caballi ejus; unde et posteri
eorum illic nati inventi sunt caudati."&mdash;<cite>Joannis Forduni

"Nit unbillich wirt der selbig lib heilig (Sant Thomas
von Candlwerg) wert gehalten, zu dem das man in seiner heiligen
legend, lumpartica historia, wie eins reines s&auml;ligen lebens er
gewesen, hat er auch ein merklich zaichen, das vielleicht bis an den
j&uuml;ngsten tag wert, hinter im verlassen; den in seinem leben reit er
auf ein zeit als ein gerechter, frommer man, auf seinem eslein, auf
ein dorf zu essen. In dem spotteten die baurn seiner reuterei und
schnitten seinem esl den schwanz ab. Darumb beklagt sich der lib
heilig, das noch auf den heutigen tag alle die knaben, die in dem dorf
geboren werden, schwenzlein, das sie zegelein nennen, ob dem hindern
an der wurzln an die welt bringen. Daraus ist das sprichwort
entsprungen, das die Englosen hoch vertreust: Engelman, den sterz her!
Und ich wolt den fraidigen gern sehen, der in dem selben dorf
'Englsterz' schreien d&ouml;rft. Er m&uuml;st sich kurz austreen, wolt er nit
erschlagen werden. W&ouml;licher frauen aber, der lust oder zeit in irer
geberung wirdet, das sie nit mer, dan &uuml;ber das wasser, in das ander
dorflein kumbt, geb&uuml;rt ir kint an (ohne) schwanz."&mdash;<cite>Die Geschichten

"Haec et talia eiusmodi ita regem Henricum moverunt, ut
ira vehementer accensus, aliquando exclamavit: 'Me miserum, non possum
in meo regno pacem cum uno sacerdoti habere? Nec quisquam meorum
omnium est, qui hac molestia liberare velit?' Ex huiusmodi vocibus,
fuerunt improbi nonnulli, quibus visa est occulta voluntas regis esse,

ut cum venisset aliquando Strodum, qui vicus situs est ad ripam
Medueiae fluminis, quod flumen Rocestriam alluit, eius loci incolae
cupidi bonum patrem ita despectum ignominia aliqua afficiendi, non

As bearing out this opinion, the following passage from
Tylor's <cite>Primitive Culture</cite> may be quoted: "But these apparently
silly myths have often a real ethnological significance. When an
ethnologist meets, in any district, with the story of tailed men, he
ought to look for a despised tribe of aborigines, outcasts, or heretics,
living near or among a dominant population who look upon them
as beasts, and furnish them with tails accordingly.... The outcast race
of Cagots, about the Pyrenees, were said to be born with tails; and in
Spain the medieval superstition still survives, that the Jews have
tails, like the devil, as they say. In England the notion was turned
to theological profit by being claimed as a judgment on wretches who
insulted St. Augustine and St. Thomas of Canterbury."&mdash;Vol. i, pp. 346-7.
